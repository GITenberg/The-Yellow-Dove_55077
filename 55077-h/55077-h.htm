<h2><a name="PRELUDE" id="PRELUDE">PRELUDE</a></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Rifts of sullen gray in the dirty veil of vapor
beyond the reaches of dunes, where the sea
in long lines of white, like the ghostly hosts
of lost regiments, clamored along the sand....</p>

<p>A soughing wind, a shrieking of sea-birds, audible
in pauses between the faraway crackle of rifle-fire and
the deep reverberations of artillery—familiar music
to ears trained by long listening. A shrill scream of
flying shrapnel, a distant crash and then a tense
hush....</p>

<p>Silence—nearly, but not quite. A sound so small
as to be almost lost in the echoes of the clamor, an
impact upon the air like the tapping of the wings of
an insect against one’s ear-drum, a persistent staccato
note which no other noise could still, borne with
curious distinctness upon some aërial current of the
fog bank.</p>

<p>And yet this tiny sound had a strange effect upon
the desolate scene, for in a moment, as if they had
been sown with dragon’s teeth, the sand dunes suddenly
vomited forth armed men who ran hither and
thither, their hands to their ears, peering aloft as
though trying to pierce the mystery of the skies.</p>

<p>“The blighter! It’s ’<em>im</em> agayn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“<em>’Im! ’Oo’s ’im</em>, I’d like to arsk?”</p>

<p>“Stow yer jaw, cawn’t yer <em>’ear</em>? Ole Yaller-belly,
agayn.”</p>

<p>The sounds were now clearly audible and to the
south a series of rapid detonations shivered the air.</p>

<p>“There goes ‘Johnny look in the air.’ Cawn’t get
’im, though. ’Strewth! ’E’s a cool one—<em>’e</em> is!”</p>

<p>A hoarse order rang out from the trenches behind
them—and the men ran for cover. The fog lifted a
little and a shaft of light touched the leaden gray of
the sea like the sheen on a dirty gun-barrel. The
nearer high-angle guns were speaking now—fruitlessly,
for the sounds seemed to come from directly
overhead. The fog lifted again and a shaft of pale
sunlight shot across the line of entrenchments.</p>

<p>“There ’e is, not wastin’ no time—<em>’e</em> ayn’t.”</p>

<p>“Yus. But they’re arfter ’im. There comes hyviashun.
O <em>’ell</em>!”</p>

<p>The expletive in a final tone of disgust for the fog
had fallen again, completely obliterating the air-craft
and its pursuers.</p>

<p>“<em>’Oo’s</em> Yaller-belly?” asked a smooth-faced youth
who still wore the sallow of London under his coat of
windburn.</p>

<p>“You’re one of the new lot, ayn’t yer? You’ll
know b——y soon ’oo Yaller-belly is, won’t ’e, Bill?
Pow! That’s ’im—them sharp ones.”</p>

<p>“Garn!” said the one called Bill. “’E never ’its
anythink but the dirt an’ ’e cawn’t ’elp that.”</p>

<p>“’Tayn’t ’cos ’e don’t try. ’Ear ’em? Nice droppin’s
fer a dove, ayn’t they?”</p>

<p>“Dove?” said the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Yus. Tubs the swine calls ’em——”</p>

<p>“Tawb, yer blighter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tub, I says. Whenever troops is moving’, ’e’s always
abaht—jus’ drops dahn hinformal-like, out o’
nowhere——”</p>

<p>“And cawn’t they catch ’im?”</p>

<p>“Catch ’im—? Bly me—not they! A thousand
’orse-power, they say ’e ’as—flies circles round hour
hair squad like they was a lot o’ bloomink captivatin’
balloons.”</p>

<p>“But the ’igh-hangles——?”</p>

<p>“Moves too fast—’ere an’ gone agayn, afore you
can fill yer cutty. They do say ’as ’ow when Yaller-belly
comes, there’s sure to be big doin’s along the
front.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Bill. “When we was dahn at Copenhagen——”</p>

<p>“Compayn, gran’pop——”</p>

<p>“Aw! Wot’s the hodds? Dahn at Copenhagen, ’e
flew abaht same as ’e’s doin’ now.”</p>

<p>Bill paused.</p>

<p>“And what happened?”</p>

<p>“You’ll ’ave to arsk Sir John abaht that, me son,”
finished the other dryly.</p>

<p>“We was drillin’ rear-guard actions, wasn’t we,
Bill?”</p>

<p>“Aye. We was drilled, right, left, an’ a bit in the
middle.” Bill rose and spat down the wind. “Tyke it
from me,” he finished, with a glance aloft through the
mist, “there’ll be somethin’ happen between ’ere an’
Wipers afore the week is hout——”</p>

<p>“Aye—the ’earse, Bill.”</p>

<p>“Wot ’earse?” asked the newcomer again.</p>

<p>“The larst time ’e kyme—down Wipers-way. There
was a lull in the firin’ an’ ’tween the lines o’ trenches
where the dead Dutchies was, comes a ’earse—a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
’earse with black ’orses, plumes an’ all. We thought
’twas some general they’d come to fetch and hup we
stands hout o’ the trenches, comp’ny after comp’ny,
caps off, all respec’ful-like. This ’ere ’earse comes
along slow an’ mournful, black curt’ins an’ all flappin’
in the wind an’ six of the blighters a-marchin’ heads
down behind it. They wheels up abreast of our
comp’ny near a mound o’ earth and stops, an’ while
we was lookin’—the front side of that there b——y
vee-Hicle drops out an’ a machine-gun begins slippin’
it into us pretty as you please. ’Earse—that’s wot
it was—a ’earse! an’ it jolly well made a funeral out
o’ B Company.”</p>

<p>“Gawd!” said the newcomer. “And Yaller-belly——?”</p>

<p>“I ayn’t sayin’ nothin’ abaht <em>’im</em>. You wait, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>The sounds of firing rose and fell again. The fog
thickened and the last crashes of the high-angle guns
echoed out to sea, but the rush of the flying planes
continued. Three machines there were by the sound
of them, but one grew ever more distinct until the
sounds of the three were merged into one. Closer it
came, until like the blast of a storm down a mountainside,
a huge shadow fell across the dunes and was gone
amid a scattering of futile shots into the fog which
might as well have been aimed at the moon.</p>

<p>Bill, the prescient, straightened and peered through
the fog toward the flying plane.</p>

<p>“A ’earse,” he muttered. “That’s wot it was—a
’earse.”</p>

<small>SHELTERED PEOPLE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Lady Betty Heathcote had a reputation in which
she took pride for giving successful dinners
in a neighborhood where successful dinners
were a rule rather than an exception. Her prescription
was simple and consisted solely in compounding
her social elements by strenuous mixing. She had a
faculty for discovering cubs with incipient manes and
saw them safely grown without mishap. At her house
in Park Lane, politics, art, literature, and science
rubbed elbows. Here pictures had been born, plays
had had their real <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">premières</i>, novels had been devised,
and poems without number, not a few of which were
indited to My Lady Betty’s eyebrow, here first saw
the light of day.</p>

<p>For all her dynamic energy in a variety of causes,
most of them wise, all of them altruistic, Lady Betty
had the rare faculty of knowing when to be restful.
Tired Cabinet ministers, overworked lords of the Admiralty,
leaders in all parties, knew that in Park Lane
there would be no questions asked which it would not
be possible to answer, that there was always an excellent
dinner to be had without frills, a lounge in
a quiet room, or, indeed, a pair of pyjamas and a
bed if necessary.</p>

<p>But since the desperate character of the war with
Germany had been driven home into the hearts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
people of London, a change had taken place in the
complexion of many private entertainments and the
same serious air which was to be noted in the mien
of well-informed people of all classes upon the street
was reflected in the faces of her guests. Her scientists
were engrossed with utilitarian problems. Her literary
men were sending vivid word-pictures of ruined
Rheims and Louvain to their brothers across the Atlantic,
and her Cabinet ministers conversed less than
usual, addressing themselves with a greater particularity
to her roasts or her spare bedrooms. Torn
between many duties, as patroness to bazaars, as head
of a variety of sewing guilds, as president of the new
association for the training and equipment of nurses,
Lady Heathcote herself showed signs of the wear and
tear of an extraordinary situation, but she managed
to meet it squarely by using every ounce of her abundant
energy and every faculty of her resourceful mind.</p>

<p>Many secrets were hers, both political and departmental,
but she kept them nobly, aware that she lived
in parlous times, when an unconsidered word might do
a damage irreparable. Agents of the enemy, she knew,
had been discovered in every walk of life, and while
she lived in London’s innermost circle, she knew that
even her own house might not have been immune from
visitors whose secret motives were open to question.
It was, therefore, with the desire to reassure herself
as to the unadulterated loyalty of her intimates that
she had carefully scrutinized her dinner lists, eliminating
all uncertain quantities through whom or by
whom the unreserved character of the conversation
across her board might in any way be jeopardized. So
it was that tonight’s dinner-table had something of
the complexion of a family party, in which John Rizzio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the bright particular star in London’s firmament
of Art, was to lend his effulgence. John Rizzio, dean
of collectors, whose wonderful house in Berkeley Square
rivaled the British Museum and the Wallace Collection
combined, an Italian by birth, an Englishman by
adoption, who because of his public benefactions had
been offered a knighthood and had refused it; John
Rizzio, who had been an intimate of King Edward, a
friend of Cabinet ministers, who knew as much about
the inner workings of the Government as majesty itself.
Long a member of Lady Heathcote’s circle, it
had been her custom to give him a dinner on the anniversary
of the day of the acquisition of the most
famous picture in his collection, “The Conningsby
Venus,” which had, before the death of the old Earl,
been the aim of collectors throughout the world.</p>

<p>As usual the selection of her guests had been left to
Rizzio, whose variety of taste in friendships could
have been no better shown than in the company which
now graced Lady Heathcote’s table. The Earl and
Countess of Kipshaven, the one artistic, the other literary;
their daughter the Honorable Jacqueline Morley;
Captain Byfield, a retired cavalry officer now on
special duty at the War Office; Lady Joyliffe, who had
lost her Earl at Mons, an interesting widow, the bud
of whose new affections was already emerging from her
weeds; John Sandys, under-secretary for foreign affairs,
the object of those affections; Miss Doris Mather,
daughter of the American cotton king, who was
known for doing unusual things, not the least of which
was her recent refusal of the hand of John Rizzio, one
of London’s catches, and the acceptance of that of the
Honorable Cyril Hammersley, the last to be mentioned
member of this distinguished company, gentleman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
sportsman and man about town, who as everybody
knew would never set the world afire.</p>

<p>No one knew how this miracle had happened, for
Doris Mather’s brains were above the ordinary; she
had a discriminating taste in books and a knowledge
of pictures, and just before dinner, upstairs in a burst
of confidence she had given her surprised hostess an
idea of what a man should be.</p>

<p>“He should be clever, Betty,” she sighed, “a worker,
a dreamer of great dreams, a firebrand in every good
cause, a patriot willing to fight to the last drop of his
blood——”</p>

<p>Lady Betty’s laughter disconcerted her and she
paused.</p>

<p>“And that is why you chose the Honorable
Cyril?”</p>

<p>Miss Mather compressed her lips and frowned at
her image in the mirror.</p>

<p>“Don’t be nasty, Betty. I couldn’t marry a man
as old as John Rizzio.”</p>

<p>Lady Betty only laughed again.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, dear, but it really is most curious. I
wouldn’t laugh if you hadn’t been so careful to describe
to me all the virtues that Cyril—hasn’t.”</p>

<p>Doris powdered the end of her nose thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I suppose they’re all a myth—men like that. They
simply don’t exist—that’s all.”</p>

<p>Lady Betty pinned a final jewel on her bodice.</p>

<p>“I’m sure John Rizzio is flattered at your choice.
Cyril is an old dear. But to marry! I’d as soon take
the automatic chess player. Why are you going to
marry Cyril, Doris?” she asked.</p>

<p>A long pause and more powder.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I am. I don’t even know why I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
thought him possible. I think it’s the feeling of the
potter for his clay. Something <em>might</em> be made of him.
He seems so helpless somehow. Men of his sort always
are. I’d like to mother him. Besides”—and she flashed
around on her hostess brightly—“he does sit a horse
like a centaur.”</p>

<p>“He’s also an excellent shot, a good chauffeur, a
tolerable dancer and the best bat in England, all agreeable
talents in a gentleman of fashion but—er—hardly——”
Lady Betty burst into laughter. “Good
Lord, Doris! Cyril a firebrand!”</p>

<p>Doris Mather eyed her hostess reproachfully and
moved toward the door into the hallway.</p>

<p>“Come, Betty,” she said with some dignity, “are
you ready to go down?”</p>

<p>All of which goes to show that matches are not made
in Heaven and that the motives of young women in
making important decisions are actuated by the most
unimportant details. Hammersley’s good fortune was
still a secret except to Miss Mather’s most intimate
friends, but the conviction was slowly growing in the
mind of the girl that unless Cyril stopped sitting
around in tweeds when everybody else was getting into
khaki, the engagement would never be announced. As
the foreign situation had grown more serious she had
seen other men who weighed less than Cyril throw off
the boredom of their London habits and go soldiering
into France. But the desperate need of his country
for able-bodied men had apparently made no impression
upon the placid mind of the Honorable Cyril. It
was as unruffled as a highland lake in mid-August. He
had contributed liberally from his large means to Lady
Heathcote’s Ambulance Fund, but his manner had become,
if anything, more bored than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Mather entered the drawing-room thoughtfully
with the helpless feeling of one who, having made a
mistake, pauses between the alternatives of tenacity
and recantation. And yet as soon as she saw him a
little tremor of pleasure passed over her. In spite of
his drooping pose, his vacant stare, his obvious inadequacy
she was sure there was something about Cyril
Hammersley that made him beyond doubt the most distinguished-looking
person in the room—not even excepting
Rizzio.</p>

<p>He came over to her at once, the monocle dropping
from his eye.</p>

<p>“Aw’fly glad. Jolly good to see you, m’dear. Handsome
no end.”</p>

<p>He took her hand and bent over her fingers. Such
a broad back he had, such a finely shaped head, such
shoulders, such strong hands that were capable of so
much but had achieved so little. And were these all
that she could have seen in him? Reason told her that
it was her mind that demanded a mate. Could it be
that she was in love with a beautiful body?</p>

<p>There was something pathetic in the way he looked
at her. She felt very sorry for him, but Betty Heathcote’s
laughter was still ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Cyril,” she said coolly. “I’ve wanted to
see you—tonight—to tell you that at last I’ve volunteered
with the Red Cross.”</p>

<p>Hammersley peered at her blankly and then with a
contortion set his eyeglass.</p>

<p>“Red Cross—you! Oh, I say now, Doris, that’s
goin’ it rather thick on a chap——”</p>

<p>“It’s true. Father’s fitting out an ambulance corps
and has promised to let me go.”</p>

<p>John Rizzio, tall, urbane, dark and cynical, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
joined them, heard her last words and broke into a
shrug.</p>

<p>“It’s the khaki, Hammersley. The women will follow
it to the ends of the earth. Broadcloth and tweeds
are not the fashion.” He ran his arm through Hammersley’s.
“There’s nothing for you and me but to
volunteer.”</p>

<p>The Honorable Cyril only stared at him blankly.</p>

<p>“Haw!” he said, which, as Lady Betty once expressed
it, was half the note of a jackass.</p>

<p>Here the Kipshavens arrived and their hostess signaled
the advance upon the dinner-table.</p>

<p>One of the secrets of the success of Lady Heathcote’s
dinners was the size and shape of her table,
which seated no more than ten and was round. Her
centerpieces were flat and her candelabra low so that
any person at the table could see and converse with
anyone else. It was thus possible delicately to remind
those who insisted on completely appropriating their
dinner partners that private matters could be much
more safely discussed in the many corners of the house
designed for the purpose. Doris sat between Rizzio
and Byfield, Hammersley with Lady Joyliffe just opposite,
and when Rizzio announced the American girl’s
decision to go to France as soon as her training
was completed she became the immediate center of interest.</p>

<p>“That’s neutrality of the right sort,” said Kipshaven
heartily. “I wish all of your countrymen felt
as you do.”</p>

<p>“I think most of them do,” replied Doris, smiling
slowly, “but you know, you haven’t always been
nice to us. There have been many times when we
felt that as an older brother you treated us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
rather shabbily. I’m heaping coals of fire, you see.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Touché!</i>” said Rizzio, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I bare my head,” said the Earl.</p>

<p>“Ashes to ashes,” from Lady Joyliffe.</p>

<p>Kipshaven smiled. “Once in England gray hairs
were venerated, even among the frivolous. Now,” he
sighed, “they are only a reproach. <em>Peccavi.</em> Forgive
me. I wish I could set the clock back.”</p>

<p>“You’d go?” asked Doris.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow,” said the old Earl with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Miss Mather glanced at Hammersley who was enjoying
his soup, a purée he liked particularly.</p>

<p>“But isn’t there something you could do?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Write, for America—for Italy—for Sweden
and Holland—for Spain. It’s something, but it isn’t
enough. My fingers are itching for a sword.”</p>

<p>The Honorable Cyril looked up.</p>

<p>“Pen mightier than sword,” he quoted vacuously,
and went on with his soup.</p>

<p>“You don’t really mean that, Hammersley,” said
Kipshaven amid smiles.</p>

<p>“Well rather,” drawled the other. “All silly rot—fightin’.
What’s the use. Spoiled my boar-shootin’
in Hesse-Nassau—no season at Carlsbad—no season
anywhere—everything the same—winter—summer——”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t think so if you were in the trenches,
my boy,” laughed Byfield.</p>

<p>“Beastly happy I’m not,” said Hammersley. “Don’t
mind shootin’ pheasant or boar. Bad form—shootin’
men—not the sportin’ thing, you know—pottin’ a bird
on the ground—’specially Germans.”</p>

<p>“<em>Boches!</em>” said Lady Betty contemptuously. She
was inclined to be intolerant. For her Algy had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
been mentioned in dispatches. “I don’t understand
you, Cyril.”</p>

<p>Hammersley regarded her gravely while Constance
Joyliffe took up his cudgels.</p>

<p>“You forget Cyril’s four years at Heidelberg.”</p>

<p>“No I don’t,” said their hostess warmly, “and I
could almost believe Cyril had German sympathies.”</p>

<p>“I have, you know,” said Hammersley calmly, sniffing
at the rim of his wineglass.</p>

<p>“This is hardly the time to confess it,” said Kipshaven
dryly.</p>

<p>Doris sat silent, aware of a deep humiliation which
seemed to envelop them both.</p>

<p>Rizzio laughed and produced a clipping from <cite>Punch</cite>.
“Hammersley is merely stoically peaceful. Listen.”
And he read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I was playing golf one day when the Germans landed<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All our troops had run away and all our ships were stranded<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the thought of England’s shame nearly put me off my game.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Amid the laughter the Honorable Cyril straightened.</p>

<p>“Silly stuff, that,” he said quite seriously, “to put a
fellow off his game.” And turning to Lady Joyliffe:
“<cite>Punch</cite> a bit brackish lately. What?”</p>

<p>“Cyril, you’re insular,” from Lady Heathcote.</p>

<p>“No, insulated,” said Doris with a flash of the eyes.</p>

<p>Rizzio laughed. “Highly potential but—er—not
dangerous. Why should he be? He’s your typical
Briton—sport-loving, calm and nerveless in the most
exacting situations—I was at Lords, you know, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Hammersley made that winning run for Marylebone—two
minutes to play. Every bowler they put up——”</p>

<p>“It’s hardly a time for bats,” put in Kipshaven
dryly. “What we need is fast bowlers—with rifles.”</p>

<p>The object of these remarks sat serenely, smiling
blandly around the table, but made no reply. In the
pause that followed Sandys was heard in a half whisper
to Byfield.</p>

<p>“What’s this I hear of a leak at the War Office?”</p>

<p>Captain Byfield glanced down the table. “Have you
heard that?”</p>

<p>“Yes. At the club.”</p>

<p>Captain Byfield touched the rim of his glass to his
lips.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard nothing of it.”</p>

<p>“What?” from a chorus.</p>

<p>“Information is getting out somewhere. I violate
no confidences in telling you. The War Office is perturbed.”</p>

<p>“How terrible!” said Lady Joyliffe. “And don’t
they suspect?”</p>

<p>“That’s the worst of it. The Germans got wind of
some of Lord Kitchener’s plans and some of the Admiralty’s—which
nobody knew but those very near
the men at the top.”</p>

<p>“A spy in that circle—unbelievable,” said Kipshaven.</p>

<p>“My authority is a man of importance. Fortunately
no damage has been done. The story goes that
we’re issuing false statements in certain channels to
mislead the enemy and find the culprit.”</p>

<p>“But how does the news reach the Germans?” asked
Rizzio.</p>

<p>“No one knows. By courier to the coast and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
by fast motor-boat perhaps; or by aëroplane. It’s
very mysterious. A huge <em>Taube</em>, yellow in color, flying
over the North Sea between England and the continent
has been sighted and reported by English vessels
again and again and each flight has coincided with
some unexpected move on the part of the enemy. Once
it was seen just before the raid at Falmouth, again before
the Zeppelin visit to Sandringham.”</p>

<p>“A yellow dove!” said Lady Kipshaven. “A bird of
ill omen, surely.”</p>

<p>“But how could such an aëroplane leave the shores
of England without being remarked?” asked Kipshaven.</p>

<p>“Oh,” laughed Sandys, “answer me that and we
have the solution of the problem. A strict watch is
being kept on the coasts, and the government employees—the
postmen, police, secret-service men of
every town and village from here to the Shetlands are
on the lookout—but not a glimpse have they had of
him, not a sign of his arrival or departure, but only
last week he was reported by a destroyer flying toward
the English coast.”</p>

<p>“Most extraordinary!” from Lady Kipshaven.</p>

<p>“It’s a large machine?” asked Rizzio.</p>

<p>“Larger than any aëroplane ever built in Europe.
They say Curtis, the American, was building a thousand
horsepower machine at Hammondsport—in the
States. This one must be at least as large as that.”</p>

<p>“But surely such a machine could not be hidden in
England for any length of time without discovery.”</p>

<p>“It would seem so—but there you are. The main
point is that he hasn’t been discovered and that its
pilot is here in England—ready to fly across the sea
with our military secrets when he gets them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“D—n him!” growled Kipshaven quite audibly, a
sentiment which echoed so truly in the hearts of those
present that it passed without comment.</p>

<p>“The captain of a merchant steamer who saw it
quite plainly reported that the power of the machine
was simply amazing—that it flew at about six thousand
feet and was lost to sight in an incredibly brief time.
In short, my friends, the Yellow Dove is one of the
miracles of the day—and its pilot one of its mysteries.”</p>

<p>“But our aviation men—can they do nothing?”</p>

<p>“What? Chase rainbows? Where shall their voyage
begin and where end? He’s over the North Sea
one minute and in Belgium the next. Our troops in
the trenches think he’s a phantom. They say even the
bombs he drops are phantoms. They are heard to explode
but nobody has ever been hit by them.”</p>

<p>“What will the War Office do?”</p>

<p>Sandys shrugged expressively. “What would <em>you</em>
do?”</p>

<p>“Shoot the beggar,” said the Honorable Cyril impassively.</p>

<p>“Shoot the moon, sir,” roared the Earl angrily.
“It’s no time for idiotic remarks. If this story is true,
a danger hangs over England. No wholesome Briton,”
here he glanced again at Hammersley, “ought to go to
sleep until this menace is discovered and destroyed.”</p>

<p>“The Yellow Dove is occult,” said Sandys, “like a
witch on a broomstick.”</p>

<p>“A Flying Dutchman,” returned Lady Joyliffe.</p>

<p>“There seems to be no joke about that,” said the
Earl.</p>

<small>THE UNDERCURRENT</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">They were still discussing the strange story of
Sandys when Lady Heathcote signaled her
feminine guests and they retired to the drawing-room.
Over the coffee the interest persisted and
Lord Kipshaven was not to be denied. If, as it seemed
probable, this German spy was making frequent flights
between England and the continent, he must have some
landing field, a hangar, a machine shop with supplies
of oil and fuel. Where in this tight little island could
a German airman descend with a thousand horsepower
machine and not be discovered unless with the connivance
of Englishmen? The thing looked bad. If there
were Englishmen in high places in London who could
be bought, there were others, many others, who
helped to form the vicious chain which led to Germany.</p>

<p>“I tell you I believe we’re honeycombed with spies,”
he growled. “For one that we’ve caught and imprisoned
or shot, there are dozens in the very midst of us.
If this thing keeps up we’ll all of us be suspecting one
another. How do I know that you, Sandys, you, Rizzio,
Byfield or even Hammersley here isn’t a secret agent of
the Germans? What dinner-table in England is safe
when spies are found in the official family at the War
Office?”</p>

<p>Rizzio smiled.</p>

<p>“We, who are about to die, salute you,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
raising his liqueur glass. “And you, Lord Kipshaven,
how can we be sure of you?”</p>

<p>“By this token,” said the old man, rising and putting
his back to the fire, “that if I even suspected, I’d
shoot any one of you down here—now, with as little
compunction as I’d kill a dog.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have my coffee first,” laughed Byfield, “if you
don’t mind.”</p>

<p>“Coffee—then coffin,” said Rizzio.</p>

<p>“Jolly unpleasant conversation this,” remarked
Hammersley. “Makes a chap a bit fidgety.”</p>

<p>“Fidgety!” roared the Earl. “We ought to be fidgety
with the Germans winning east and west and the
finest flower of our service already killed in battle. We
need men and still more men. Any able-bodied fellow
under forty who stays at home”—and he glanced meaningly
at the Honorable Cyril—“ought to be put to
work mending roads.”</p>

<p>The object of these remarks turned the blank stare
of his monocle but made no reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean you, Cyril,” went on the Earl steadily.
“Your mother was born a Prussian. I knew her well
and I think she learned to thank God that fortune had
given her an Englishman for a husband. But the taint
is in you. Your brother has been wounded at the
front. His blood is cleansed. But what of yours?
You went to a German university with your Prussian
kinsmen and now openly flaunt your sympathies at a
dinner of British patriots. Speak up. How do you
stand? Your friends demand it.”</p>

<p>Hammersley turned his cigarette carefully in its
long amber holder.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Lord Kipshaven,” he said with a slow
smile, “you’re not spoofing a chap, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was never more in earnest in my life. How do
you stand?”</p>

<p>“Haw!” said Hammersley with obvious effort. “I’m
British, you know, and all that sort of thing. How can
an Englishman be anything else? Silly rot—fightin’—that’s
what I say. That’s all I say,” he finished looking
calmly for approval from one to the other.</p>

<p>Smiles from Sandys and Rizzio met this inadequacy,
but the Earl, after glaring at him moodily for a moment,
uttered a smothered, “Paugh,” and shrugging a
shoulder, turned to Rizzio and Sandys who were discussing
a recent submarine raid.</p>

<p>Hammersley and Byfield sat near each other at the
side of the table away from the others. There was a
moment of silence—which Hammersley improved by
blowing smoke rings toward the ceiling. Captain Byfield
watched him a moment and then after a glance in
the direction of the Earl leaned carelessly on an elbow
toward Hammersley.</p>

<p>“Any shootin’ at the North?” he asked.</p>

<p>Hammersley’s monocle dropped and the eyes of the
two men met.</p>

<p>“Yes. I’m shootin’ the day after tomorrow,” said
Hammersley quietly. Byfield looked away and another
long moment of silence followed. Then the Honorable
Cyril after a puff or two took the long amber holder
from his mouth, removed the cigarette and smudged the
ash upon the receiver.</p>

<p>“Bally heady cigarettes, these of Algy’s. Don’t
happen to have any ’baccy and papers about you, do
you, Byfield?”</p>

<p>“Well, rather,” replied the captain. And he pushed
a pouch and a package of cigarette papers along the
tablecloth. “It’s a mix of my own. I hope you’ll like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Hammersley opened the bag and sniffed at its contents.</p>

<p>“Good stuff, that. Virginia, Perique and a bit of
Turkish. What?”</p>

<p>Byfield nodded and watched Hammersley as he
poured out the tobacco, rolled the paper and lighted
it at the candelabra, inhaling luxuriously.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he sighed. “Jolly good of you,” and he
pushed the pouch back to Byfield along the table.</p>

<p>“You must come to Scotland some day, old chap,”
said the Honorable Cyril carelessly.</p>

<p>“Delighted. When the war is over,” returned Byfield
quietly. “Not until the war is over.”</p>

<p>“Awf’ly glad to have you any time, you know—awf’ly
glad.”</p>

<p>“In case of furlough—I’ll look you up.”</p>

<p>“Do,” said the Honorable Cyril.</p>

<p>Hammersley’s rather bovine gaze passed slowly
around the room, and just over Lord Kipshaven’s head
in the mirror over the mantel it met the dark gaze of
John Rizzio. The fraction of a second it paused there
and then he stretched his long legs and rose, stifling a
yawn.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in—what?” he said to Byfield.</p>

<p>Byfield got up and at the same time there was a
movement at the mantel.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too hard on the chap,” Rizzio was saying
in an undertone to Kipshaven. “You’re singing the
‘Hassgesang.’ He’s harmless—I tell you—positively
harmless.” And then as the others moved toward the
door: “Come, Lady Heathcote won’t mind our tobacco.”</p>

<p>Hammersley led the way, with Byfield and Rizzio
at his heels. Jacqueline Morley had been trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
play the piano, but there was no heart in the music
until she struck up “Tipperary,” when there was a
generous chorus in which the men joined.</p>

<p>Hammersley found Doris with Constance Joyliffe
in an alcove. At his approach Lady Joyliffe retired.</p>

<p>“Handsome, no end,” he murmured to her as he
sank beside her.</p>

<p>“Handsome is as handsome does, Cyril,” she said
slowly. “If you knew what I was thinking of, you
wouldn’t be so generous.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Just what everybody is thinking about you—that
you’ve got to do something—enlist to fight—go to
France, if only as a chauffeur. They’d let you do that
tomorrow if you’d go.”</p>

<p>“Chauffeur! Me! Not really!”</p>

<p>“Yes, that or something else,” determinedly.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment and then went on distinctly.</p>

<p>“Because I could never marry a man people talked
about as people are talking about you.”</p>

<p>“Not marry—?” The Honorable Cyril’s face for
the first time that evening showed an expression of concern.
“Not marry—me? You can’t mean that,
Doris.”</p>

<p>“I do mean it, Cyril,” she said firmly. “I can’t
marry you.”</p>

<p>“Why——?”</p>

<p>“Because to me love is a sacrament. Love of woman—love
of country, but the last is the greater of the
two. No man who isn’t a patriot is fit to be a husband.”</p>

<p>“A patriot——”</p>

<p>She broke in before he could protest. “Yes—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
patriot. You’re not a patriot—that is, if you’re an
Englishman. I don’t know you, Cyril. You puzzle
me. You’re lukewarm. Day after day you’ve seen
your friends and mine go off in uniform, but it doesn’t
mean anything to you. It doesn’t mean anything to
you that England is in danger and that she needs
every man who can be spared at home to go to the
front. You see them go and the only thing it means
to you is that you’re losing club-mates and sport-mates.
Instead of taking the infection of fervor—you
go to Scotland—to shoot—not Germans but—deer!
Deer!” she repeated scathingly.</p>

<p>“But there aren’t any Germans in Scotland—at least
none that a chap could shoot,” he said with a smile.</p>

<p>“Then go where there <em>are</em> Germans to shoot,” she
said impetuously. She put her face to her hands a
moment. “Oh, don’t you understand? You’ve got to
prove yourself. You’ve got to make people stop speaking
of you as I’ve heard them speak of you tonight.
Here you are in the midst of friends, people who know
you and like you, but what must other people who
don’t know you so well or care so much as we? What
must they think and say of your indifference, of your
openly expressed sympathy with England’s enemies?
Even Lady Betty, a kinswoman and one of your truest
friends, has lost patience with you—I had almost said
lost confidence in you.”</p>

<p>Her voice trailed into silence. Hammersley was
moving the toe of his varnished boot along the border
of the Aubusson rug.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” he said slowly. “Awf’ly sorry.”</p>

<p>“Sorry! Are you? But what are you going to do
about it?”</p>

<p>“Do?” he said vaguely. “I don’t know, I’m sure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I’m no bally use, you know. Wouldn’t be any bally use
over there. Make some silly ass mistake probably.
No end of trouble—all around.”</p>

<p>“And you’re willing to sacrifice the goodwill, the
affection of your friends, the respect of the girl you
say you love——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Doris. Not that——”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve got to tell you. I can’t be unfair to
myself. I can’t respect a man who sees others cheerfully
carrying <em>his</em> burdens, doing <em>his</em> work, accepting
<em>his</em> hardships in order that he may sleep soundly at
home far away from the nightmare of shot and shell.
<em>You</em>, Cyril, <em>you</em>! Is it that—the love of ease? Or is
it something else—something to do with your German
kinship—the memory of your mother. What is it?
If you still want me, Cyril, it is my right to know——”</p>

<p>“Want you, Doris—” his voice went a little lower.
“Yes, I want you. You might know that.”</p>

<p>“Then you must tell me.”</p>

<p>He hesitated and peered at the eyeglass in his fingers.</p>

<p>“I think—it’s because I—” He paused and then
crossed his hands and bowed his head with an air of
relinquishment. “Because I think I must be a”—he
almost whispered the word—“a coward.”</p>

<p>Doris Mather gazed at him a long moment of mingled
dismay and incredulity.</p>

<p>“You,” she whispered, “the first sportsman of England—a—a
coward.”</p>

<p>He gave a short mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>“Queer, isn’t it, the way a chap feels about such
things? I always hated the idea of being mangled.
Awf’ly unpleasant idea that—’specially in the tummy.
In India once I saw a chap——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“You—a coward!” Doris repeated, wide-eyed. “I
don’t believe you.”</p>

<p>He bent his head again.</p>

<p>“I—I’m afraid you’d better,” he said uncertainly.</p>

<p>She rose, still looking at him incredulously, another
doubt, a more dreadful one, winging its flight to and
fro across her inner vision.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said in a tone she hardly recognized
as her own, “come let us join the others.”</p>

<p>He stood uncertainly and as she started to go,</p>

<p>“You’ll let me take you home, Doris?” he asked.</p>

<p>She bent her head, and without replying made her
way to the group beyond the alcove.</p>

<p>Hammersley stood a moment watching her diminishing
back and then a curious expression, half of trouble,
half of resolution, came into his eyes.</p>

<p>Then after a quick glance around the curtain he
suddenly reached into his trousers pocket, took something
out and scrutinized it carefully by the light of
the lamp. He put it back quickly and setting his
monocle sauntered forth into the room. As he moved
to join the group at the piano John Rizzio met him
in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>“Could I have a word with you, Hammersley?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Happy,” said the Honorable Cyril. “Here?”</p>

<p>“In the smoking-room—if you don’t mind?”</p>

<p>Hammersley hesitated a moment and then swung on
his heels and led the way. At the smoking-room door
from the hallway Rizzio paused, then quietly drew the
heavy curtains behind them.</p>

<p>Hammersley, standing by the table, followed this
action with a kind of bored curiosity, aware that Rizzio’s
dark gaze had never once left him since they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
entered the room. Slowly Hammersley took his hands
from his pockets, reached into his waistcoat for his
cigarette case, and as Rizzio approached, opened and
offered it to him.</p>

<p>“Smoke?” he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>“I don’t mind if I do. But I’ve taken a curious liking
for rolled cigarettes. Ah! I thought so.” He
opened the tobacco jar and sniffed at it, searched
around the articles on the table, then, “How disappointing!
Nothing but Algy’s dreadful pipes. You
don’t happen to have any rice-papers do you?”</p>

<p>Hammersley was lighting his own cigarette at the
brazier.</p>

<p>“No. Sorry,” he replied laconically.</p>

<p>Rizzio leaned beside him against the edge of the
table.</p>

<p>“Strange. I thought I saw you making a cigarette
in the dining-room.”</p>

<p>Hammersley’s face brightened. “Oh, yes, Byfield.
Byfield has rice-papers.”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have yours,” he said quietly.</p>

<p>The Honorable Cyril looked up.</p>

<p>“Mine, old chap? I thought I told you I hadn’t
any.”</p>

<p>Rizzio smiled amiably.</p>

<p>“Then I must have misunderstood you,” he said
politely.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hammersley and sank into an armchair.</p>

<p>Rizzio did not move and the Honorable Cyril, his
head back, was already blowing smoke rings.</p>

<p>Rizzio suddenly relaxed with a laugh and put his
legs over a small chair near Hammersley’s and folded
his arms along its back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know, Hammersley,” he said with a laugh,
“I sometimes think that as I grow older my hearing
is not as good as it used to be. Perhaps you’ll say
that I cling to my vanishing youth with a fatuous
desperation. I do. Rather silly, isn’t it, because I’m
quite forty-five. But I’ve a curiosity, even in so small
a matter, to learn whether things are as bad with me as
I think they are. Now unless you’re going to add a
few more gray hairs to my head by telling me that I’m
losing my sight as well as my hearing, you’ll gratify
my curiosity—an idle curiosity, if you like, but still
strangely important to my peace of mind.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment and looked at Cyril, who was
examining him with frank bewilderment.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I understand,” said Hammersley politely.</p>

<p>“I’ll try to make it clearer. Something has happened
tonight that makes me think that I’m getting
either blind or deaf or both. To begin with I thought
you said you had no cigarette papers. If I heard you
wrong, then the burden of proof rests upon my ears—if
my eyes are at fault it’s high time I consulted a
specialist, because you know, at the table in the dining-room
when you were sitting with Byfield, quite distinctly
I saw you put a package of Riz-la-Croix into
your right-hand trousers pocket. The color as you
know is yellow—a color to which my optic nerve is
peculiarly sensitive.” He laughed again. “I know
you’d hardly go out of your way to make a misstatement
on so small a matter, and if you don’t mind satisfying
a foible of my vanity, I wish you’d tell me
whether or not I’m mistaken.”</p>

<p>He stopped and looked at Hammersley who was regarding
him with polite, if puzzled tolerance. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
as if realizing that something was required of him
Hammersley leaned forward.</p>

<p>“I say, Rizzio. What the deuce is it all about?
I’m sorry you’re gettin’ old an’ all that sort of thing,
but I can’t help it. Now can I, old chap?”</p>

<p>Rizzio’s smile slowly faded and his gaze passed
Hammersley and rested on the brass fender of the
fireplace.</p>

<p>“You don’t care to tell me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“About that package of rice-papers.”</p>

<p>“Byfield has them.”</p>

<p>“Not that package,” put in Rizzio with a wave of
the hand. And then, leaning forward, in a low tone,
“The other.”</p>

<p>Hammersley sat upright a moment, his hands on the
chair-arms and then sank back in his chair with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“I say. I can take a joke as well as the next, but—er—what’s
the answer?”</p>

<p>Rizzio rose, his graceful figure dominant.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that sort of thing will do, Hammersley.”</p>

<p>His demeanor was perfectly correct, his hand-wave
easy and a well-bred smile flickered at his lips, but
his tone masked a mystery. Hammersley rose, removing
his cigarette with great deliberateness from its
holder and throwing it into the fire.</p>

<p>“If there isn’t anything else you want to see me
about—” He took a step in the direction of the
door.</p>

<p>“One moment, please.”</p>

<p>Hammersley paused.</p>

<p>“I think we’d better drop subterfuge. I know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
why you were here tonight, why Byfield was here and
perhaps you know now why I am here.”</p>

<p>“Can’t imagine, I’m sure,” said Cyril.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you can guess, when I tell you that this
party was of my own choosing—that my plans were
made with a view to arranging your meeting with Captain
Byfield in a place known to be above suspicion.
I have been empowered to relieve you of any further
responsibility in the matter in question—in short of
the papers themselves.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say. Vanished youth, cigarette papers and
all that. You’re goin’ it a bit thick, Rizzio, old boy.”</p>

<p>Rizzio put a hand into the inside pocket of his evening
coat and drew out a card-case, which he opened
under Hammersley’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Look, Hammersley,” he whispered. “Maxwell gave
me this! Perhaps you understand now.”</p>

<p>The Honorable Cyril fixed his eyeglass carefully and
stared at the card-case.</p>

<p>“By Jove,” he muttered, with sudden interest.</p>

<p>“Now you understand?” said Rizzio.</p>

<p>“You!” whispered Hammersley, looking at him. The
languor of a moment before had fallen from him with
his dropping monocle.</p>

<p>“Yes, I. Now quick, the papers,” muttered Rizzio,
putting the card-case in his pocket. “Someone may
come at any moment.”</p>

<p>For a long space of time Hammersley stood uncertainly
peering down at the pattern in the rug, then he
straightened and, crossing the room, put his back to
the fireplace.</p>

<p>“There may be a mistake,” he said firmly. “I can’t
risk it.”</p>

<p>Rizzio stood for a moment staring at him as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
he had not heard correctly. Then he crossed over and
faced the other man.</p>

<p>“You mean that?”</p>

<p>Hammersley put his hands in his trousers pockets.</p>

<p>“I fancy so.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“What I’ve been told to do.”</p>

<p>“My orders supersede yours.”</p>

<p>“H-m. I’m not sure.”</p>

<p>“You can’t doubt my credentials.”</p>

<p>“Hardly that. Er—I think I know best, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Rizzio took a pace or two before the fireplace in
front of him, his brows tangled, his fingers twitching
behind his back. Then he stopped with the air of a
man who has reached a decision.</p>

<p>“You understand what this refusal means?”</p>

<p>Hammersley shrugged.</p>

<p>“You realize that it makes you an object of suspicion?”
asked the other.</p>

<p>“How? In doing what was expected of me?” said
Hammersley easily.</p>

<p>“You are expected to give those papers to me.”</p>

<p>“I can’t.”</p>

<p>Rizzio’s fine face had gone a shade paler under the
glossy black of his hair and his eyes gleamed dangerously
under his shaggy brows. He measured the Honorable
Cyril’s six feet two against his own and then
turned away.</p>

<p>“I think I understand,” he said slowly. “Your action
leaves me no other alternative.”</p>

<p>Hammersley, his hands still deep in his pockets,
seemed to be thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. Each man according to
his lights. You have your orders. I have mine. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
seem to conflict. I’m going to carry mine out. If that
interferes with carrying out yours, I’m not to blame.
It’s what happens in the end that matters,” he finished
significantly.</p>

<p>Rizzio thought deeply for a moment.</p>

<p>“You’ll at least let me see them?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I have my own reasons.”</p>

<p>Another pause in which Rizzio gave every appearance
of a baffled man.</p>

<p>“You realize that if I gave the alarm and those
papers were found on you——”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t do that.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because of your card-case.”</p>

<p>“That signifies nothing to anyone but you and me.”</p>

<p>Hammersley smiled.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the risk, Rizzio,” he said finally.</p>

<p>The two men had been so absorbed in their conversation
that they had not heard the drawing of the curtains
of the door, but a sound made them turn and
there stood Doris Mather.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<small>RICE-PAPERS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Doris looked from the man whose hand she had
accepted to the one she had refused. Their
attitudes were eloquent of concealment and
the few phrases which had reached her ears as she
paused outside the curtain did nothing to relieve the
sudden tension of her fears. She hesitated for a moment
as Rizzio recovered himself with an effort.</p>

<p>“Do come in, Doris,” he said with a smile. “Hammersley
and I were—er——”</p>

<p>“Discussing the scrap of paper. I’m sure of it,”
she said coolly. “Nothing is so fruitful of argument.
I shouldn’t have intruded, but Cyril was to take me
home and I’m ready to go.”</p>

<p>A look passed between the men.</p>

<p>“By Jove—of course,” said Cyril with a glance at
his watch. “If you’ll excuse me, Rizzio——”</p>

<p>“Betty is going to Scotland tomorrow early and I
think she wants to go to bed.”</p>

<p>Rizzio laughed. “The war has made us virtuous.
Eleven o’clock! We’re losing our beauty sleep.”</p>

<p>He followed them to the door, but pleading a desire
for a night-cap, remained in the smoking-room.</p>

<p>“I promised that you should take me home,” said
the girl to Hammersley as they passed along the hall.
“But I’m sorry if I interrupted——”</p>

<p>“Awf’ly glad,” he murmured. “Nothing important,
you know. Club matter. Personal.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Doris stopped just outside the drawing-room door
and searched his face keenly, while she whispered:</p>

<p>“And the threats—of exposure. Oh, I heard that.
I couldn’t help it—Cyril—”</p>

<p>He glanced down at her quickly.</p>

<p>“Hush, Doris.”</p>

<p>Something she saw in his expression changed her
resolution to question him. The mystery which she
had felt to hang about him since he had said he was a
coward had deepened. Something told her that she
had been treading on forbidden ground and that in
obeying him she served his interests best, so she led
the way into the drawing-room, where they made their
adieux.</p>

<p>Byfield had already gone and Sandys and Lady
Joyliffe were just getting into their wraps.</p>

<p>“You’ll meet me here at ten?” their hostess was asking
of Constance Joyliffe.</p>

<p>“If I’m not demolished by a Zeppelin in the meanwhile,”
laughed the widow.</p>

<p>“Or the Yellow Dove,” said Jacqueline Morley.
“I’m <em>sure</em> he alights on the roofs of the Parliament
Houses.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be safe in Scotland at any rate, Constance.
We’re quite too unimportant up there to be visited by
engines of destruction—” she laughed meaningly.
“That is—always excepting Jack Sandys.”</p>

<p>Sandys looked self-conscious, but Lady Joyliffe
merely beamed benignly.</p>

<p>“It will really be quite restful, I’m sure,” she said
easily. “Is Cyril going to be at Ben-a-Chielt?”</p>

<p>Hammersley awoke from a fit of abstraction.</p>

<p>“Quite possible,” he murmured, “gettin’ to be a bit
of a hermit lately. Like it though—rather.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cyril hasn’t anyone to play with,” said Betty
Heathcote, “so he has taken to building chicken-houses.”</p>

<p>“Fearfully absorbin’—chicken-houses. Workin’ ’em
out on a plan of my own. You’ll see. Goin’ in for
hens to lay two eggs a day.” And then to Kipshaven,
“So the submarines can’t starve us out, you know,”
he explained.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you need worry about that,” said the
Earl dryly, moving toward the door.</p>

<p>Doris Mather went upstairs for her wraps and when
she came down she found Hammersley in his topcoat
awaiting her. As they went down the steps into the
waiting limousine her companion offered her his arm.
Was it only fancy that gave her the impression that
his glance was searching the darkness of the Park beyond
the lights of the waiting cars with a keenness
which seemed uncalled for on so prosaic an occasion?
He helped her in and gave the direction to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Ashwater Park, Stryker, by way of Hampstead—and
hurry,” she heard him say, which was surprising
since the nearer way lay through Harlenden and Harrow-on-Hill.
The orders to hurry, too, save in the
stress of need, were under the circumstances hardly
flattering to her self-esteem. But she remembered the
urgent look in his eyes in the hall when he had silenced
her questions and sank back in the seat, her gaze fixed
on the gloom of Hyde Park to their left, waiting for
him to speak. He sat rigidly beside her, his hands
clasped about his stick, his eyes peering straight before
him at the back of Stryker’s head. She felt his
restraint and a little bitterly remembered the cause
of it, buoyed by a hope that since he had thought it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
fit to enact a lie, the whole tissue of doubts which assailed
her might be based on misconception also. That
he was no coward she knew. More than one instance of
his physical courage came back to her, incidents of his
life before fortune had thrown them together and she
only too well remembered the time when he had jumped
from her car and thrown himself in front of a runaway
horse, saving the necks of the occupants of the
vehicle. He had lied to her. But why—why?</p>

<p>She closed her eyes trying to shut out the darkness
and seek the sanctuary of some inner light, but she
failed to find it. It seemed as though the gloom which
spread over London had fallen over her spirit.</p>

<p>“The City of Dreadful Night,” she murmured at
last. “I can’t ever seem to get used to it.”</p>

<p>She heard his light laugh and the sound of it comforted
her.</p>

<p>“Jolly murky, isn’t it? I miss that fireworks Johnny
pourin’ whiskey over by Waterloo Bridge—and Big
Ben. Doesn’t seem like London. All rot anyway.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think there’s danger,” she asked cautiously.</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment before replying. And then,
“No,” he said, “not now.”</p>

<p>Silence fell over them again. It was as though a
shape sat between, a phantom of her dead hopes and
his, something so cold and tangible that she drew away
in her own corner and looked out at the meaningless
blur of the sleeping city. Her lips were tightly closed.
She had given him his chance to speak, but he had not
spoken and every foot of road that they traversed
seemed to carry them further apart. The end of their
journey—! Was it to be the end ... of everything
between them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while that seemed interminable she heard
his voice again.</p>

<p>“I suppose you think I’m an awful rotter.”</p>

<p>She turned her head and tried to read his face, but
he kept it away from her, toward the opposite window.
The feeling that she had voiced to Betty Heathcote
of wanting to “mother” him came over her in a warm
effusion.</p>

<p>“Nothing that you can <em>say</em> to me will make me think
you one, Cyril,” she said gently.</p>

<p>“Thanks awf’ly,” he murmured. And after a pause,
“I am though, you know.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward impulsively and laid a hand on
his knee.</p>

<p>“No. You’re acting strangely, but I know that
there’s a reason for it. As for your being a coward”—she
laughed softly—“it’s impossible—quite impossible
to make me believe that.”</p>

<p>He laid his fingers over hers for a moment.</p>

<p>“Nice of you to have confidence in a chap and all
that, but appearances are against me—that’s the difficulty.”</p>

<p>“Why are they against you? Why should they be
against you? Because you—” She stopped, for
here she felt that she was approaching dangerous
ground. Instead of parleying longer, she used her
woman’s weapons frankly and leaning toward him put
an arm around his neck and compelled him to turn
his face to hers. “Oh, Cyril, won’t you tell me what this
mystery is that is coming between us? Won’t you let
me help you? I want to be in the sunlight with you
again. It can’t go on this way, one of us in the dark
and the other in the light. I have felt it for weeks.
When I spoke to you tonight about going to France it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was in the hope that you might give me some explanation
that would satisfy me. My heart is wrapped up
in the cause of England, but if the German blood in
you is calling you away from your duties as an Englishman,
tell me frankly and I will try to forgive you,
but don’t let the shadow stay over us any longer, Cyril.
I must know the truth. What is the mystery that
hangs over you and makes——”</p>

<p>“Mystery?” he put in quickly. “You’re a bit seedy,
Doris. Thinkin’ too much about the war. Nothin’
mysterious about me.” He turned his head away from
her again. “People don’t like my sittin’ tight—here
in England,” he said more slowly, “when all the chaps
I know are off to the front. I—I can’t help it. That’s
all.”</p>

<p>“But it’s so unlike you,” she pleaded. “It’s the
sporting thing, Cyril.”</p>

<p>“I want you to believe,” he put in slowly, “it isn’t
the kind of sport I care for.”</p>

<p>“I won’t believe it. I can’t. I know you better than
that.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble,” he insisted. “I’m afraid you
don’t know me at all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know you tonight,” she said sadly. “It
almost seems as though you were trying to get rid
of me.”</p>

<p>He clasped her tightly in his arms and kissed her
gently.</p>

<p>“God forbid,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Then tell me what it is that is worrying you,” she
whispered. “Not a living soul shall ever know. What
were the threats of exposure that passed between you
and Rizzio. He can’t bear you any illwill because I
chose you instead of him. I didn’t mean to listen but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
I couldn’t help it. What was the menace in his tone
to you? What is the danger that hangs over you that
puts you in his power? It’s my right to know. Tell
me, Cyril. Tell me.”</p>

<p>She felt the pressure of the arm around her relax
and the sudden rigidity of his whole body as he drew
away.</p>

<p>“I think you must have been mistaken in what
you say you heard,” he said evenly. “I told you that
it was a personal matter—a club matter in which you
couldn’t possibly be interested.”</p>

<p>They were speaking formally now, almost as strangers.
She felt the indifference in his tone and couldn’t
restrain the bitterness that rose in hers.</p>

<p>“One gentleman doesn’t threaten a club-mate with
exposure in a club matter unless—unless he has done
something discreditable—something dishonorable——”</p>

<p>The Honorable Cyril bent his head.</p>

<p>“You have guessed,” he said. “He—he is jealous.
He wants to humiliate me.”</p>

<p>She laughed miserably. “Then why did you threaten
him?”</p>

<p>“I had to defend myself.”</p>

<p>“You! Dishonorable! I’ll have to have proofs of
that. What are the papers you have that he wants?
And what is there incriminating in Rizzio’s card-case?
You see, I heard everything.”</p>

<p>“What else did you hear?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p>She drew away from him and sank back heavily in
her corner.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she muttered. “Isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p>It seemed to the girl as though her companion’s
figure relaxed a little. And he turned toward her
gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t bother about me. I’m not worth bothering
about. The worst of it is that I can’t make any explanation—at
least any that will satisfy you. All I
ask is that you have patience with me if you can, trust
me if you can, and try to forget—try to forget what
you have heard. If you should mention my conversation
with Rizzio it might lead to grave consequences
for him—for me.”</p>

<p>The girl listened as though in a nightmare, the
suspicions that had been slowly gathering in her brain
throughout the evening now focusing upon him from
every incident with a persistence that was not to be
denied. The shape sat between them again, more tangible,
more cold and cruel than before. All his excuses,
all his explanations gave it substance and reality.
The phantom of their dead hopes it had been
before—now it was something more sinister—something
that put all thoughts of the Cyril she knew from
her mind—the shade of Judas fawning for his pieces
of silver—a pale Judas in a monocle.... She closed
her eyes again and tried to think. Cyril! It was
unbelievable.... And a moment ago he had kissed
her. She felt again the touch of his lips on her forehead....
It seemed as though she too were being
betrayed.</p>

<p>“You ask something very difficult of me,” she stammered
chokingly.</p>

<p>“I can only ask,” he said, “and only hope that you’ll
take my word for its importance.”</p>

<p>She shivered in her corner. The sound of his voice
was so impersonal, so different from the easy bantering
tone to which she was accustomed, that it seemed
that what he had said was true—that she did not know
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Another surprise awaited her, for he leaned forward,
peering into the mirror beside the wind shield in front
of Stryker and turned and looked quickly out of the
rear window of the car. Then she heard his voice in
quick peremptory notes through the speaking-tube.</p>

<p>“There’s a car behind us. Lose it.”</p>

<p>The driver touched his cap and she felt the machine
leap forward. The thin stream of light far in front
of them played on the gray road and danced on the
dim façades of unlighted houses which emerged from
the obscurity, slid by and were lost again as the car
twisted and turned, rocking from side to side, moving
ever more rapidly toward the open country to the
north. The dark corners of cross streets menaced
for a moment and were gone. A reflector gleamed from
one, but they went by it without slowing, the signal
shrieking. A flash full upon them, a sound of voices
cursing in the darkness and the danger was passed!
At the end of a long piece of straight road Cyril
turned again and reached for the speaking-tube. But
his voice was quite cool.</p>

<p>“They’re coming on. Faster, Stryker.”</p>

<p>And faster they went. They had reached the region
of semi-detached villas and the going was good. The
road was a narrow ribbon of light reeling in upon its
spool with frightful rapidity. The machine was a
fine one and its usual well-ordered purr had grown
into a roar which seemed to threaten immediate disruption.</p>

<p>Doris sat rigidly, clutching at the door sill and seat
trying to adjust her braced muscles to the task of
keeping upright. But a jolt of the car tore her grasp
loose and threw her into Cyril’s arms and there he
held her steadily. She was too disturbed to resist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
lay quietly, conscious of the strength of the long arms
that enfolded her and aware in spite of herself of a
sense of exhilaration and triumph. Triumph with
Cyril! What triumph—over whom? It didn’t seem
to matter just then whom he was trying to escape.
She seemed very safe in his arms and very contented
though the car rocked ominously, while its headlight
whirled drunkenly in a wild orbit of tossed shadows.
The sportswoman in her responded to the call of speed,
the chance of accident, the danger of capture—for she
felt sure now that there was a danger to Cyril. Over
her shoulder she saw the lights of the pursuing machine,
glowing unblinkingly as though endowed with a
persistence which couldn’t know failure. Under the
light of an incandescent she saw that its lines were
those of a touring-car and realized the handicap of
the heavy car with its limousine body. But Stryker
was doing his best, running with a wide throttle picking
his road with a skill which would have done credit
to Cyril himself. The heath was already behind them.
At Hendon, having gained a little, Stryker put out his
lights and turned into a by-road hoping to slip away
in the darkness, but as luck would have it the moon
was bright and in a moment they saw the long spoke of
light swing in behind them.</p>

<p>“Good driver, that Johnny,” she heard her companion
say in a note of admiration to Stryker. “Have
to run for it again.”</p>

<p>The road was not so good here and they lost time
without the searchlights, so Stryker turned them on
again. This evasion of the straight issue of speed had
been a confession of weakness and the other car seemed
to realize it, for it came on at increased speed which
shortened the distance so that the figures of the occupants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the other were plainly discernible, five men in
all, huddled low.</p>

<p>A good piece of road widened the distance. The
limousine, now thoroughly warmed, was doing the best
that she was capable of and the tires Cyril told her
were all new. Her question seemed to give him an idea,
for he reached for the flower vase and, thrusting out
a hand, jerked it back into the road.</p>

<p>“A torn tire might help a little,” he said.</p>

<p>But the fellow behind swerved and came faster.</p>

<p>It was now a test of metal. Their pursuer lagged a
little on the levels but caught them on the grades and,
barring an accident, it was doubtful whether they
would reach the gates of Ashwater Park safely. She
heard a reflection of this in Cyril’s voice as he shouted
through the open front window.</p>

<p>“How far by the road, Stryker?”</p>

<p>“Five miles, I’d say, sir.”</p>

<p>“Give her all she can take.”</p>

<p>Stryker nodded and from a hill crest they seemed to
soar into space. The car shivered and groaned like a
stricken thing, but kept on down the hill without the
touch of a brake. They crossed a bridge, rattled from
side to side. Cyril steadied the girl in his arms and
held her tight.</p>

<p>“Are you frightened?” he asked her.</p>

<p>“No. But what is it all about?”</p>

<p>Her companion glanced back to where the long
beams of light were searching their dust. When he
turned toward her his face was grave. He held her
closely for a moment, peering into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Will you help me, Doris?” she heard him say.</p>

<p>“But how? What can I do, Cyril?”</p>

<p>He hesitated again, glancing over his shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bally nuisance to have to drive you like this.
Wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t most important——”</p>

<p>“Yes——”</p>

<p>“They want something I’ve got——”</p>

<p>“Papers?”</p>

<p>“You’ll laugh when I tell you. Most amusin’—cigarette
papers!”</p>

<p>“Cigarette——”</p>

<p>“That’s all. I give you my word. Here they are.”
And reaching down into his trousers pocket he produced
a little yellow packet. “Cigarette papers, that’s
all. These chaps must be perishin’ for a smoke.
What?” he laughed.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t necessary that you should. Take my word
for it, won’t you? It’s what they want. And I’m jolly
determined they’re not goin’ to get it.”</p>

<p>“You want me to help you? How?”</p>

<p>He looked back again and the lights behind them
found a reflection in his eyes. If, earlier in the evening
she had hoped to see him fully awake, she had her
wish now. He was quite cool and ready to take an
amused view of things, but in his coolness she felt a
new power, an inventiveness, a readiness to resort to
extremes to baffle his pursuers. Her apprehension
had grown with the moments. Who were these men in
the touring-car? Special agents of Scotland Yard?
She had never been so doubtful nor so proud of him.
Weighed in the balance of emotion the woman in her
decided it. She caught at his hand impulsively.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll help—if I can—whatever comes.”</p>

<p>He raised her fingers to his lips and kissed them
gently.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” he muttered. “I knew you would.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
He looked over his shoulder and then peered out in
search of familiar land-marks. They had passed Canons
Hill and swung into the main road to Watford. If
they reached there safely they would get to Ashwater
Park which was but a short distance beyond.</p>

<p>She heard him speaking again and felt something
thrust into the palm of her hand.</p>

<p>“Take this,” he said. “It’s what they want. They
mustn’t get it.”</p>

<p>“But who are <em>they</em>?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Except that they’ve been sent by
Rizzio.”</p>

<p>“Rizzio!”</p>

<p>“Yes. He’s not with them. This sort of game requires
chaps of a different type.”</p>

<p>“You mean that they——”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be alarmed. They won’t hurt me and of
course they won’t hurt you. I’m going to get you out
of the way—with this. My success depends on you.
We’ll drive past the Park entrance close to wicket
gate in the hedge near the house. Just as we stop,
jump out, run through and hide among the shrubbery.
Your cloak is dark. They won’t see you. When
they’re gone, make your way to the house. It’s a
chance, but I’ve got to take it.”</p>

<p>“And you?” she faltered.</p>

<p>“I’ll get away. Don’t worry. But the packet.
Whatever happens don’t let them get the packet.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said in a daze, “I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Keep it for me, until I come. But don’t examine
it. It’s quite unimportant to anybody but me——”
he laughed, “that is, anybody but Rizzio.”</p>

<p>She stared straight in front of her trying to think,
but thought seemed impossible. The speed had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
into her blood and she was mastered by a spirit
stronger than her own. He held her in his arms again
and she gloried in the thought that she could help
him. Whatever his cause, her heart and soul were
in it.</p>

<p>They roared into Watford and, turning sharp to
the left, took the road to Croxley Green. The machine
hadn’t missed a spark but the touring-car was creeping
up—was so close that its lights were blinding them.
Hammersley leaned forward and gave a hurried order
to Stryker. They passed the Park gates at full speed—the
wicket gate was a quarter of a mile beyond.
Would they make it? The touring-car was roaring up
alongside but Stryker jockeyed it into the gutter.
Voices were shouting and Doris got the gleam of something
in the hand of a tall figure standing up in the
other car. There followed shots—four of them—and
an ominous sound came from somewhere underneath as
the limousine limped forward.</p>

<p>“It’s our right rear tire,” said Stryker.</p>

<p>“Have we a spare wheel,” she heard Cyril say.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“When we stop put it on as quick as you can. A
hundred yards. Easy—so and we’re there, Stryker.
Now. Over to the left and give ’em the road. Quick!
Now stop!”</p>

<p>The other machine came alongside at their right and
the men jumped down just as Cyril threw open the
left-hand door and Doris leaped out and went through
the gate in the hedge.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>DANGEROUS SECRETS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Once within the borders of her father’s estate
and hidden in a clump of bushes near the
hedge, all idea of flight left Doris’s head. She
was home and the familiar scene gave her confidence.
From the middle of her clump of bushes grew a spruce
tree, and into it she quickly climbed until she reached a
point where she could see the figures in the road beside
the quivering machines. She had not been followed.
The five men were gathered around Cyril, who was
protesting violently at the outrage. They had not
missed her yet. Stryker was on his knees beside the
stricken wheel.</p>

<p>“Come, now,” she heard the leader saying, “you’re
not to be hurt if you’ll give ’em up.”</p>

<p>“Why, old chap, you’re mad,” Cyril was saying
coolly. “I was thinkin’ you wanted my watch. You
chase me twenty miles in the dead of night and then
ask me for cigarette papers. You’re chaffin’—what?”</p>

<p>“You’ll find out soon enough,” said the tall man
gruffly. “Off with his coat, Jim.... Now search
him.”</p>

<p>Cyril made no resistance. Doris could see his face
quite plainly. He was smiling.</p>

<p>“Rum go, this,” he said with a puzzled air. “I only
smoke made cigarettes, you know.”</p>

<p>But they searched him thoroughly, even taking off
his shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“I say, stop it,” she heard him laugh. “You’re
ticklin’.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, d—n you,” said the tall man, with a
scowl.</p>

<p>“Right-o!” said Cyril, cheerfully. “But you’re wastin’
time.”</p>

<p>They found that out in a while and the leader of
the men straightened. Suddenly he gave a sound of
triumph.</p>

<p>“The girl!” he cried and, rushing to the limousine,
threw open the door.</p>

<p>“Gone!” he shouted excitedly. “She can’t be far.
Find her.”</p>

<p>He rushed around the rear wheels of the limousine
and for the first time spied the gate in the hedge.</p>

<p>“Tricked, by God! In after her, some of you.”</p>

<p>“It won’t do a bit of good,” remarked Cyril. He
was sitting in the dirt of the middle of the road near
the front wheels of the machines. “She doesn’t smoke,
o’ chap. Bad taste, I call it, gettin’ a lady mixed up
in a hunt for cigarettes. Besides she’s almost home by
this. The house isn’t far. She lives there, you know.”</p>

<p>In her tree Doris trembled. She was well screened
by the branches and she heard the crackle of footsteps
in the dry leaves as the searchers beat the bushes below
her, but they passed on, following the path toward
the house. As the sounds diminished in the distance
she saw Cyril still seated on the ground leaning against
the front wheels of the touring-car while he argued and
cajoled the men nearest him. Helping himself by a
wheel as he arose he faced the tall man who had come
up waving his revolver and uttering wild threats.</p>

<p>“It won’t help matters calling me a lot of names,”
said Cyril, brushing the dust from his clothes. “You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
want something I haven’t got—that’s flat. I hope
you’re satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Not yet. They’ll bring the girl in a minute. She
can’t have gone far.”</p>

<p>Cyril glanced around him carelessly and brushed
his clothes again.</p>

<p>He had discovered that Stryker had put on the
spare wheel and was parleying with one of their captors.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. Have your way. What more can
I do for you? If you don’t mind I’d like to be going
on.”</p>

<p>“You’ll wait for the girl—here.”</p>

<p>Doris watched Stryker skulking along in the shadow
of the limousine. She saw him reach his seat, heard a
grinding of the clutches and a confused scuffle out of
which, <a href="#image01">his blond hair disheveled, his shoulders coatless,
Cyril emerged</a> and leaped for the running-board of
the moving machine.</p>

<p>“You forgot to search the limousine,” she heard him
shout.</p>

<p>The tall man scrambled to his knees and fired at the
retreating machine while the others jumped for the
touring-car.</p>

<p>It had no sooner begun to move than there was a
sound of escaping air and an oath from the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“A puncture,” someone said. And Doris heard a
volley of curses which spoke eloquently of the sharpness
of Cyril’s pocket-knife.</p>

<p>Doris in her hiding-place breathed a sigh of relief.
Cyril had gotten safely off, and his last words had created
a diversion in the camp of the enemy. They were
working furiously at the tire, but she knew that the
chance of coming up with Cyril again that night was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
gone. Now that the affair had resulted so favorably
to Cyril she began to regret her imprudence in remaining
to see the adventure to its end. Cyril had played
for time, and if she had followed his instructions she
could have gotten far enough away to have eluded her
pursuers. By this time, in all probability, she would
have been safe beneath the parental roof. The worst
of it was that Cyril thought her safe. The packet in
her glove burned in her hand. Beneath her, somewhere
between her refuge and the house were two men,
and how to pass them with her precious possession became
now the sole object of her thoughts. Cyril had
told her that the packet must under no circumstances
fall into the hands of their pursuers and the desperateness
of his efforts to elude them gave her a renewed
sense of her importance as an instrument for good or
ill in Cyril’s cause—whatever it might be. Now that
Cyril had gone she felt singularly helpless and small
in the face of such odds. For a moment she thought
of hiding the packet in the crotch of one of the
branches where she might come and reclaim it at her
leisure and go down and run the chance of being taken
without it. But the unpleasantness which might result
from such an encounter deterred her, and so she
sat, her chilly ankles depending, awaiting she knew not
what. She had almost reconciled herself to the thought
of spending several hours in this uncomfortable position
when the tall man in the road blew a blast on a
sporting whistle and soon the passing of footsteps
through the gate advised her that the men inside the
grounds had returned.</p>

<p>This was her opportunity, and without waiting to
listen she dropped quietly down on the side of the tree
away from the gate and, stealing furtively along in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the shadow of the hedge, made her way as quickly as
possible in the direction of the house. Out of breath
with exercise and excitement, when she reached a patch
of trees at the edge of the lawn, she stopped and looked
behind her. Then she blessed her luck in coming down
when she did, for she saw the thin ray of a pocket
light gleaming like a will-o’-the-wisp in her place of
concealment and knew that the search for her was
still on.</p>

<p>Fear lent her caution. She skirted the edge of the
wide lawn in the shadow of the trees, running like a deer
across the moonlit spaces, always keeping the masses
of evergreens between her and the wicket gate until
she reached the flower garden, where she paused a moment
to get her breath. A patch of moonlight lay between
her and the entrance and the hedge was impenetrable.
There was no other way. She bent low and
hurried forward, trusting to the good fortune that
had so far aided her. Halfway across the open she
heard a shout and knew that she had been seen.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it but to run straight for the
house. So catching her skirts up above her knees and
scorning the garden path which would have taken her
a longer way, she made straight for the terrace, the
main door of which she knew had been left open for her
return. Across the wide lawn in the bright moonlight
she ran, her heart throbbing madly, the precious yellow
packet clutched tightly against her palm. Out
of the tail of her eye she saw dark forms emerge from
the bushes and run diagonally for the terrace steps in
the hope of intercepting her. But she was fast, and
she blessed her tennis for the wind and muscle to stand
the strain. She was much nearer her goal than her
pursuers, but they came rapidly, their bulk looming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
larger every moment. She saw the lights and knew
that servants were at hand. Her father, too, was in
the library, for she saw the glow of his reading-lamp.
She had only to shout for help now and someone would
hear her. She tried to, but not a sound came from her
parching throat. With a last effort she raced up the
terrace steps, pushed open the heavy door and shut
and bolted it quickly behind her. Then sank into the
nearest piece of furniture in a state of physical collapse.</p>

<p>Doris Mather did not faint, an act which might
readily have been forgiven her under the circumstances.
Her nerves were shaken by the violence of her exercise
and the narrowness of her escape, and it was some moments
before she could reply to the anxious questions
that were put to her. Then she answered evasively,
peering through the windows at the moonlit lawn and
seeing no sign of her pursuers. In a few moments she
drank a glass of water and took the arm of Wilson,
her maid, up the stairway to her rooms, after giving
orders to the servants that her father was not to be
told anything except that she had come in very tired
and had gone directly to bed.</p>

<p>For the present at least Cyril’s packet was safe.
In her dressing-room Wilson took off her cloak and
helped her into bedroom slippers, not, however, without
a comment on the bedraggled state of her dinner
dress and the shocking condition of her slippers. But
Doris explained with some care that Mr. Hammersley’s
machine had had a blow-out near the wicket gate, that
she had become frightened and had run all the way
across the lawn. All of which was true. It didn’t
explain Mr. Hammersley’s deficiencies as an escort,
but Wilson was too well trained to presume further.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
A little sherry and a biscuit and Doris revived rapidly.
While the maid drew her bath she locked Cyril’s
cigarette papers in the drawer of the desk in her bedroom,
and when she was bathed and ready for the
night she dismissed Wilson to her dressing-room to
wait within call until she had gone to bed.</p>

<p>Alone with her thoughts, her first act was to turn
out her lights and kneel in the window where she could
peer out through the hangings. It was inconceivable
that her pursuers would dare to make any attempt
upon the house, but even now she wondered whether it
would not have been wiser if she had taken her father
into her confidence and had the gardeners out to keep
an eye open for suspicious characters. But the motives
that had kept her silent downstairs in the hall
were even stronger with her now. She could not have
borne to discuss with her father, who had an extraordinary
talent for getting at the root of difficulties, the
subject of Cyril’s questionable packet of cigarette
papers. She was quite sure, from the adventure which
had befallen them tonight, and the mystery with which
Cyril had chosen to invest the article committed to
her care, that Cyril himself would not have approved
of any course which would have brought the packet or
his own actions into the light of publicity.</p>

<p>The packet of cigarette papers! With a last scrutiny
of the landscape she pulled the shades and hangings
so that no ray of light could reach the outside of
the house, then groped her way across the room. A
thin line of light beneath the door of her dressing-room
showed that Wilson was still there. So she took
the precaution of locking that door as well as the others
leading to the upstairs hall, then went to her desk
and turned on her lamp. She unlocked the drawer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the desk and taking the small object gingerly in her
fingers, scrutinized it carefully. It was yellow in
color, quite new, bound with a small rubber band, a
very prosaic, a very harmless looking object to have
caused so much excitement and trouble to all who had
been concerned about it. She turned it over and
stretched its rubber band, snapping it thoughtfully
two or three times. Now for the first time since Cyril
had given it to her did she permit herself to think of
the hidden meanings the thing might possess. In the
machine, during the chase Cyril had won her unreservedly
to his side. As against the mysterious men
of John Rizzio Cyril’s cause had been the only one to
be considered. She had been carried off her feet and
there hadn’t been time to think of anything but the
real necessity of acceding to Cyril’s wishes in getting
the small object to a place of safety. Then it had only
been a packet of cigarette papers—a mere package of
Riz-la-Croix which everybody, for some reason or
other, seemed to want. Now, weighed lightly in her
hand, the seclusion of her room gave it a different
character. She recalled Cyril’s bantering tone at having
been chased twenty miles for a cigarette. But his
attitude deceived Doris no more than it had his pursuers.
There was material here for something more
deadly than cigarettes. She took the yellow packet
in both hands and pressed it to her temples as though
by this act she could pass its secrets into her own
brain. In spite of herself she was frightfully curious
and frightfully afraid.</p>

<p>She got up and paced the floor rapidly. No—it
couldn’t go on. She must know the truth. As the key
of the one unopened room fascinated Blue Beard’s wife,
as the box fascinated Pandora, so this unopened yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
packet plagued and fascinated Doris Mather. She
hesitated another long moment and then slipped off the
rubber band and opened it, trembling so that the first
leaf of paper came out in her fingers and fell to the
floor. She picked the paper up and examined it minutely,
holding it up to the light. There was nothing
unusual about it, no mark, no sign of any kind that
might indicate a secret mission. Leaf by leaf, slowly
at first and then more rapidly she went through the
leaves, examining each page back and front, without
success. It was not until she was almost half through
it that she came upon the writing—four pages written
lengthways in ink with a line too fine almost for legibility.</p>

<p>She put the packet down for a moment, her heart
throbbing with excitement and incredulity, too apprehensive
to read, in mortal dread of a revelation which
was to change the whole course of her life and Cyril’s.
There was still time to close the book and go to bed.
Why did she sit there holding the thing open, stupidly
gazing at nothing? If Cyril——</p>

<p>Yes, if Cyril was the unspeakable thing of her
doubts, it was time that she knew it and no compunctions
of honor should hold her with such a man. Besides
she had promised him nothing. Hesitating no
longer, she held the leaves under the light of her lamp
and slowly deciphered the thin script.</p>

<p>At first she could make little of it, as it seemed to
consist of numerals which she couldn’t understand,
but here and there she made out the names of towns,
the names of regiments familiar to her and a series of
dates, beginning in March and ending in May. As the
meaning of the writing grew clearer to her, she read
on, her eyes distended with horror. Even a child could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
have seen that this was a list of the British forces
under arms, the proposed dates for the completion of
their equipment, training and departure for France.
When she had finished reading the written pages, her
inert fingers slowly turned the blank papers over to
the end. There was nothing more. God knows it was
enough! Cyril—the Honorable Cyril—a spy of the
Germans!</p>

<p>She sank low in her armchair, her senses numb from
the horror of the revelation. Her thoughts became
confused like those of a sick person awaking from a
nightmare to a half consciousness, peopled with
strange beautiful images doing the dark things of
dreams. Cyril—<em>her</em> Cyril—a spy!</p>

<p>What would happen now. And which way did duty
lie? Toward England or toward Cyril? She sat
crouched on the floor in an agony of misery at the
thought of Cyril’s baseness, the package of paper
clenched in her hand, trying to think clearly for England,
for Cyril, for herself, but the longer she battled
the deeper became her desperation and despair.</p>

<p>The world seemed to be slipping away from her, the
orderly arrangement of her thoughts was twisted and
distorted so that wrong had become right and right
wrong. She had lost her standard of judgment. She
did not know which way to turn, so she bent her head
forward into her hands and silently prayed. There
seemed to be nothing else to do. For a long while she
remained prostrate by the window, her brain tortured,
her body stiff with weariness, until she could think no
more. Then slowly and painfully she rose and, still
clutching the yellow packet, groped her way to bed,
into which she fell exhausted in mind and body.</p>

<small>THE PURSUIT CONTINUES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At eight o’clock Doris was awakened by a loud
knocking on the door leading to her dressing-room.
She had slept the sleep of utter exhaustion
and aroused herself with difficulty, a little bewildered
at the unusual sounds. Then she dimly remembered
locking the door and got quickly out of bed,
put the yellow packet in the drawer of her desk and
pushed back the bolt of the door.</p>

<p>To her surprise her father confronted her and behind
him were other members of the family in various
stages of their morning toilets.</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord,” said David Mather with a sigh
of relief.</p>

<p>“What on earth is the matter?” asked the girl,
glancing from one to the other in alarm.</p>

<p>Her father laughed. “Oh, nothing, now that you’re
all right. Burglars, that’s all.”</p>

<p>Doris’s heart stopped beating as in a flash of reviving
memory the incidents of the night before came
quickly back to her.</p>

<p>“Burglars!” she stammered.</p>

<p>“Yes, they got in here—came up the water spout,”
pointing to the dressing-room window, “and a fine mess
they made of things. You’ll have to take account of
stock, child, and see how you stand.”</p>

<p>She glanced around the disordered room, very much
alarmed. The drawers of her cupboards were all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
pulled out and their contents scattered about on the
floor.</p>

<p>“When did—did it happen?” she asked timorously,
more because she had to say something than because
that was what she wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Some time before dawn,” said her father. “Wilson
was here until three thinking that you might want
her and then went out to her own room in the wing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” said the girl, passing her hand
across her eyes. “I wasn’t feeling very well—so I
asked her to stay here for a while. But I can’t understand
why I didn’t wake.”</p>

<p>“That’s what frightened us,” Cousin Tom broke in.
“We were afraid the snoozers might have got in to
you——”</p>

<p>“It’s lucky you had your door locked.”</p>

<p>“They were at my library desk, too,” she heard her
father saying. “Must have gone down the hall from
here. But so far as I can see, they didn’t get anything.”</p>

<p>Her Aunt Sophia gasped a sigh.</p>

<p>“Thank the Lord,” she put in reverently. “At least
we’re all safe and sound.”</p>

<p>Stunned at the daring of Rizzio’s men and bewildered
by the persistence with which they had followed
their quest while she was sleeping, Doris managed to
formulate a quick plan to hide the meaning of this
intrusion from the members of her family.</p>

<p>She had been examining the disordered contents of
the upper drawers of a bureau.</p>

<p>“My jewel case, fortunately, I keep in my bedroom,”
she said, “but there was an emerald brooch to
be repaired which I put in this drawer yesterday. It’s
gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>She saw a puzzled look come into the eyes of Wilson,
who stood near the window, and a glance passed between
them.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” her father said as he turned toward the
door, “we’re lucky it wasn’t worse. I’m ’phoning to
Watford for a constable.”</p>

<p>This was what Doris had feared and yet she could
not protest. So she shut her lips firmly and let them
go out of the room, leaving her alone with Wilson.</p>

<p>She knew that the woman was devoted to her and
that she was not in the habit of talking belowstairs,
but her mistress had seen the look of incredulity in the
woman’s eyes last night and the puzzled expression a
moment ago which indicated a suspicion connecting
Doris’s arrival in the Hall with the mysterious entrance
of the dressing-room. Doris knew that she
must tell her something that would satisfy her curiosity.</p>

<p>“My bath please, Wilson,” she said coolly in order
to gain time. “And say nothing, you understand.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Miss Mather,” said Wilson, with her
broad Kentish smile. “I wouldn’t ha’ dreamed of it.”</p>

<p>The cool water refreshed and invigorated the girl,
and she planned skillfully. By the time Wilson
brought her breakfast tray she had already wrapped
the yellow packet of cigarette papers and her Cousin
Tom’s tobacco pouch in a pair of silk stockings surrounded
by many thicknesses of paper and in a disguised
handwriting had addressed it to Lady Heathcote
at her place in Scotland. She had also written
a note to Betty advising her of a change in plans and
of her intention to come to her upon the following day,
asking in a postscript twice underlined to keep a certain
package addressed to her and carefully described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
safely under lock and key for her without opening
until her arrival. She would explain later.</p>

<p>A gleam of hope had penetrated to her through the
gloom that encompassed her thoughts—only a gleam
at the best, but it was enough to give her courage to go
on with her efforts to save Cyril from immediate danger.
And this was the belief born of the forcible and
secret entry of the house that the men who were in
pursuit of the fateful packet were not in any way connected
with Scotland Yard or the War Office. Otherwise
if they believed the papers to be in her possession
they would have come boldly in the light of day and
demanded of her father the right to search the house.
These were not times when the War Office hesitated in
matters which concerned the public interest. John
Rizzio, for some reason which she could not fathom,
was acting upon his own initiative with a desire as
urgent as Cyril’s to keep his object secret.</p>

<p>She pondered those things for a long while and then
with a sigh of uncertainty dismissed them from her
thoughts, which were too full of the immediate necessity
to carry out her carefully formulated plans. First
she called Wilson and after assuring herself that she
was making no mistake, took her partially into confidence,
telling her of the important paper intrusted by
Mr. Hammersley to her care which it was to the interest
of other persons to possess and the necessity for
getting them safely out of the house. Her mistress’s
confidences flattered the maid and she entered very
willingly into the affair, concealing the emerald brooch
which Doris produced from her jewel box, in a trunk
containing old clothes which had long stood neglected
in a dusty corner of the attic.</p>

<p>After the visit of the man from Watford, who went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
over the situation with a puzzled brow and departed
still puzzled, she confided to her father the letter
and package which were to be mailed from London,
the letter in the morning, the package not until
night.</p>

<p>“Don’t fail me, daddy. It’s <em>very</em> important——”
she said as she kissed him. “It’s a surprise for Betty,
but it mustn’t get to Scotland until tomorrow night
at the earliest. And good-by——” And she kissed
him again. “I’m going with it.”</p>

<p>“Tonight?”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Mr. Mather smiled and pinched her cheeks. He was
quite accustomed to sudden changes of plan on the
part of his daughter and would as soon have thought
of questioning them as he would the changes in the
weather. He hadn’t liked the idea of her hunting or
playing polo, but she had done them both and cajoled
him into approving of her. He had objected fearfully
when she went in for aviation, but had learned to watch
the flights of her little Nieuport with growing confidence
and had even erected a shed for her machines in
the meadow behind the stables.</p>

<p>“Take care of yourself,” he said lightly. “You’re
looking a little peaky lately. If you don’t get rosier
I’ll withdraw my ambulance corps.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Don’t forget!” she flung after him
as he got into the car.</p>

<p>With the departure of the yellow packet a weight
had been lifted from Doris’s mind. John Rizzio’s men
might come now if they liked—and she would invite
them to search the place. She was not in the least
afraid of herself, and she knew that the danger to
Cyril had passed—at least for the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>She hoped that Cyril wouldn’t come today—or telephone
her. She wanted time to think of what she
should say to him. At moments it even seemed as
though she didn’t care if she ever saw him again. But
as the day passed and she had no word from him, she
grew anxious. What if Rizzio had told the War Office!</p>

<p>That night men from Watford kept a watch upon
the house, but there was no disturbance. Her watchers
had evidently taken the alarm. But it was in no
very certain or very happy state that Doris drove her
machine out of the gate of the Park in the later afternoon
of the next day with her cousin Tom beside her
and Wilson and the luggage in the rear seat. The
main road to London was empty of vehicles except for
a man on a motor-cycle just ahead of her bound in the
same direction. At least, she was no longer to be
watched. There was plenty of time, so she drove
leisurely, reaching Euston Station with twenty minutes
to spare. She sent a wire to Lady Heathcote and
then Tom saw her safely into her carriage.</p>

<p>The movement of the train soothed her and she
closed her eyes and slept, Wilson like a watchful Gorgon,
guarding against intrusion.</p>

<p>There was but one incident which destroyed the
peace of the journey. Toward morning, Wilson, who
slept with one eye open, wakened her suddenly and
asked her quietly to look out of the window. Her
train had stopped at a large station, the platform of
which was well lighted. From the darkness of their
compartment she followed the direction of Wilson’s
figure. Outside, pacing the platform and smoking
cigarettes, were two men.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Doris, half asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“The big one,” whispered Wilson excitedly. “It
was him that was ridin’ the motor-cycle.”</p>

<p>Doris remembered passing and repassing the vehicle
on the road to London, and the face of its driver came
back to her. She peered out at him eagerly and as
the man turned she saw the face and figure of the
larger man clearly. It was the motor-cycle man, and
in a rush the thought came to her that his figure and
bearing were strangely familiar.</p>

<p>“It’s true,” she whispered, her fingers on Wilson’s
arm. “We’re followed. It’s the same man. Last
night, too.”</p>

<p>“Last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes. It’s the man called Jim, who searched Mr.
Hammersley in the road.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Wilson, her eyes brightening. “You
don’t say so, Miss Mather. Of all the brazen——”</p>

<p>“Sh—” said Doris.</p>

<p>But there was no more sleep for either of them that
night. Bolt upright, side by side, they watched the
dawn grow into sunrise and the sunrise into broad day.
They saw no more of the motor-cycle man and Doris
reassured herself that there was nothing to be feared
now that the packet was— She started in affright.
The packet at Betty Heathcote’s! Perhaps at this very
moment lying innocently in Betty’s post-box or in the
careless hands of some stupid Scotch gardener, or
worse yet inviting curiosity on Betty’s desk or library
table. Her heart sank within her as she realized that
her brave plans might yet miscarry.</p>

<p>It was with a sense of joyous relief that the train
pulled at last into Innerwick Station. When she got
down she saw Betty Heathcote’s yellow brake, the four
chestnuts restive in the keen moorland air, and looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
very youthful and handsome in a brown coat which
made the symphony complete, the lady herself, the
wind in her cheeks and in her cheery greeting.</p>

<p>“Of course, Doris, you’re to be trusted to do something
surprising. Oh, here’s Jack Sandys—you didn’t
know, of course.”</p>

<p>The sight of these familiar faces gave Doris renewed
confidence, and when from the box seat she
glanced around in search of her pursuer he had disappeared.</p>

<p>Sandys clambered up behind them. Wilson got into
the back seat with the grooms, the boxes went in between,
and they were off.</p>

<p>“Constance was tired, Jack. At least she said she
was. I really think that all she wanted was to disappoint
you. Nothing like disappointment. It breeds
aspiration. But,” she added mischievously, “I’m sure
she’s <em>dying</em> to see you. Awf’ly sad—especially since
it’s not quite forty-eight hours since you were waving
a tearful good-by in Euston Station.”</p>

<p>“Did you get my package?” whispered Doris in her
ear, at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>“What package? Oh, yes, the stockings. It was
torn and awf’ly muddy. Higgins dropped it from the
dog-cart on the way over and had to go back for it.
Lucky he found it—in the middle of the road. What
a silly thing to make such a mystery of. And the
cigarette papers—you might be sure I’d have something
to smoke at Kilmorack House. I can’t understand.
You really <em>could</em> smoke here if you want to
without so much secrecy about it.”</p>

<p>“I—I didn’t know,” stammered the girl. “I—I’ve
just taken it up and I thought you mightn’t approve.”</p>

<p>Betty glanced at her narrowly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whatever ails you, child? <em>I</em> disapprove! You
know I smoke when I feel like it—which isn’t often.”</p>

<p>The subject fortunately was turned when they
passed the road to Ben-a-Chielt.</p>

<p>“I always envied Cyril his cliffs. I love the sea and
Cyril hates it. ‘So jolly restless,’” she mimicked him.
“Makes one ‘quiggledy.’ And there I am—away inland—five
miles to the firth at the very nearest. But I
suppose,” she sighed, “one has to overlook the deficiencies
of one’s grandfather. If he had known I’d
have liked the sea, Cyril, of course, would have come
into <em>my</em> place.”</p>

<p>With this kind of light chatter, of which Lady
Heathcote possessed a fund, their whip drove them
upon their way, her own fine spirits oblivious of the
silence of her companions. But at last she glanced
at them suspiciously. “If I didn’t know that you were
both hopelessly in love with other persons, I’d think
you were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">épris</i> of each other.”</p>

<p>Doris laughed.</p>

<p>“We are. That’s why we chose opposite ends of
the train.”</p>

<p>But Sandys only smiled.</p>

<p>“Nothing that’s happening makes a chap happy
nowadays. I bring bad news.”</p>

<p>Lady Heathcote relaxed the reins so that one of
her leaders plunged madly, while her face went white.</p>

<p>“Not Algy——”</p>

<p>“No, no—forgive me. He’s safe. I’ve kept watch
of the bulletins.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” said Lady Heathcote, and sent her
whiplash swirling over the ears of the erring leader.</p>

<p>“Not Algy—Byfield——”</p>

<p>“Byfield—not dead——?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“No. Worse.”</p>

<p>“What——?”</p>

<p>“In prison. He was taken into custody yesterday
afternoon as he was leaving the War Office. Orders
from ‘K.’”</p>

<p>“You can’t mean that Richard Byfield is——”</p>

<p>Sandys nodded quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes. He was one of the leaks—a spy.”</p>

<p>“A spy!” Betty Heathcote whispered in awestricken
tones. “A spy—Dick! Horrible! I can’t—I
won’t——”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately there’s not the least doubt about
it. They found incriminating evidence at his
rooms.”</p>

<p>“My God!” said Lady Heathcote. “What are
we coming to? Dick Byfield—why, two nights
ago he was a guest at my table—with you, and
you——”</p>

<p>Doris nodded faintly, the landscape swimming in a
dark mist before her eyes. Byfield—Cyril—Rizzio—all
three had been at Lady Heathcote’s dinner. Something
had happened that night—only a part of which
she knew. Byfield was arrested—and Cyril—— She
clutched desperately at the edge of the seat and set
her jaw to keep herself from speaking Cyril’s name.</p>

<p>“Were there—any others?” she asked, with an
effort.</p>

<p>“None so far. But there must have been others.
God help them! They won’t get any mercy.”</p>

<p>“But what made him do such a thing?” asked Betty.
“I could have sworn——”</p>

<p>“Money—lots of it. He wasn’t very well off, you
know.”</p>

<p>They were swinging over the ridge towards Kilmorack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
House in a tragic silence mocked by the high jubilant
notes of the coach horn which the groom was
winding to announce their approach.</p>

<p>Doris got down swiftly, summoning her courage to
be silent and wait. In the drawing-room when the
news was told, Constance Joyliffe added another note
of gloom.</p>

<p>“We’re going to be a lively party,” said Lady
Heathcote bitterly. “Thank the Lord, John Rizzio
is coming.”</p>

<p>“Rizzio!”</p>

<p>Doris flashed around, her terror written so plainly
that anyone might read.</p>

<p>“Yes. I had his wire at Innerwick when I was waiting
for you.” And then catching the girl by the arm,
“Why, dear, what is the matter?”</p>

<p>“I—I think I’ll go up to my room if you don’t
mind, Betty. I won’t have any luncheon. A cup of
tea is all.” She moved toward the door, her hand in
Lady Heathcote’s. “And Betty—the package, please—I—I
think it may soothe me to smoke.”</p>

<p>Betty examined her quizzically but made no comment,
though she couldn’t understand such a strange
proceeding in a girl who was accustomed to do exactly
as she pleased. She got the package from her
desk in the library and handed Doris the silk stockings,
tobacco, and the yellow packet. The wrapping paper
which had been soiled had been relegated to the scrap-basket.</p>

<p>“And Betty——” pleaded Doris as she quickly took
them, “promise me that you won’t tell John Rizzio.”</p>

<p>Lady Heathcote glanced at her quickly and then
laughed.</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m the least curious woman in Scotland,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
she laughed, “but I would really like to
know——”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me, Betty,” Doris pleaded. “I’ve a reason—a
silly one, perhaps, but I ask you—not to
speak of this—to anyone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well,” said Lady Heathcote, “I won’t.
But don’t be mysterious. All mysteries nowadays are
looked on with suspicion. Even such an innocent little
mystery”—and she laughed—“as a package of cigarette
papers.”</p>

<p>Doris made some light reply and went to her room,
where, with the doors locked, she quickly examined the
packet to be sure that it had not been tampered with.
Nothing seemed to have been changed and she gave
a sigh of relief to think that thus far her secret had
escaped detection. It was very clear to her now that
John Rizzio had decided that the secret information
was in her possession and that his visit was planned
with the object of getting it away from her. This
should never be. By the light of the window she read
and re-read the thin script until the lines were etched
upon her memory. She would burn the papers if they
were in danger. If Cyril was to meet Captain Byfield’s
fate, it would be upon other evidence than this.
Her hands, at least with regard to Cyril, must be
clean.</p>

<p>A knock upon the door and she hurriedly thrust the
packet under a table cover and answered. It was the
maid with her tea, and upon the tray lay a note in an
unfamiliar handwriting. When the maid had gone
she tore the flap and read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mr. Hammersley begs that Miss Mather will not
be unduly alarmed upon his account. Business of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
an urgent nature has detained him but he assures
her that he will join her at the earliest possible moment.
He begs that she will be careful.</p></div>

<p>There was no signature and the handwriting was
curious—like none to which she was accustomed, but
the message seemed somehow to sound like Cyril. She
rang for the maid, questioned her, and found that the
note had just come over by messenger from Ben-a-Chielt.</p>

<p>When the maid went down, Doris re-read the
message thankfully. Cyril was safe—at least for the
present. And her relief in the knowledge was the true
measure of her relation to him. Whatever else he was,
he was the man she had promised to marry—the man
who a little later would have been hers for better or
for worse. And between Cyril and John Rizzio it had
not been difficult to choose. It did not seem difficult
now.</p>

<p>She took up the packet of papers and paused before
the open fire, a smile playing for the first time at
the corners of her lips. John Rizzio! He was clever,
as she knew, but there was more than one way of playing
the game. Perhaps with her John Rizzio might
be at a disadvantage. She hesitated a moment and
then—pulled up her skirts and slipped the yellow
packet into her stocking.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>RIZZIO TAKES CHARGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Rizzio was to arrive that night. Meanwhile,
with the papers hidden about her and bright
fires burning in all the living-rooms of the
house in which they could in a moment be destroyed,
Doris thought herself well placed upon the defensive.
Cyril’s note had cheered her, and after removing the
dust of her journey she went down into the library,
where she joined the other members of the house party
assembled. Black seemed to be the prevailing color,
for, in addition to the weeds of Lady Constance, there
was Wilfred Hammersley, Cyril’s uncle, who had lost
an only son at La Bassée, and the Heatherington girls,
who had lost a brother.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” Lady Betty was saying. “I came to Scotland
to try and forget, but the war follows me. Dick
Byfield a traitor! Who next? Let’s not even speak
of it. Come, I’ve ordered the brake, Doris. We’re
going out for a spin. You and I and Angeline. Constance
of course has a headache, and Jack will be
having another for sympathy.”</p>

<p>The air outside was life-giving, and when she returned
later Doris felt that her brain had been swept
clear of its cobwebs of perplexity. She found Wilson
standing in her room gazing with a puzzled expression
at the tray of her unpacked box, the contents of
which were in a state of confusion.</p>

<p>“It’s strange, Miss Mather. Someone has been at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
your things while I was down in the servants’ hall at
luncheon.”</p>

<p>“You’re sure?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Miss Mather, sure. Quite positive, in fact.
Those waists were lying flat when I left.”</p>

<p>“The window wasn’t open?” asked Doris with a
glance around.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Miss.” She looked about and lowered her
voice. “It’s somebody inside.”</p>

<p>“Curious,” said Doris thoughtfully. “Nothing has
been taken? Is the jewel box there?”</p>

<p>Together they examined the things and found that
nothing was missing.</p>

<p>“Say nothing about this, Wilson,” said Doris
thoughtfully. “Unless something is taken, I shouldn’t
care to disturb Lady Heathcote.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be——” Wilson paused, her voice hushed.</p>

<p>“The papers are safe, Wilson—as long as I am
safe,” replied the girl, and told the maid of her place
of concealment.</p>

<p>Wilson looked dubious. “I wish you’d give them
to me, Miss Mather.”</p>

<p>But the girl shook her head—she was thoroughly
alive now to the perils which hung about her, here
within the very doors of Lady Heathcote’s house, but
she had determined that if she could not find it possible
to keep the papers until Cyril appeared she
would destroy them. She was not frightened, for however
clumsy John Rizzio’s agents might be she was
in no danger from himself. Whatever the interests
which made the possession of the yellow packet so
vital, she knew the man well enough to be sure that
if there came an issue between them, he would act with
her as he had always acted—the part of a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Instead of apprehension at his approaching visit
she now felt only interest and a kind of suppressed exhilaration
as at the prospect of a flight in a new plane
or the trying out of a green hunter—excitement like
that which preceded all her sportive ventures.</p>

<p>So that when she met John Rizzio in the drawing-room
after dinner—he had not been able to manage
a more opportune train—she gave him a warm hand-clasp
of greeting and a smile which caused him some
surprise and not a little regret—surprise that she was
carrying off a difficult situation with consummate ease;
regret that such self-possession and artistry were not
to be added to the ornaments of his house in Berkeley
Square. Perhaps still——</p>

<p>“How agreeable,” she was saying charmingly. “The
great man actually condescends to come to the land
of Calvin, oatcake and sulphur, when there are truffles
and old Madeira still to be had in London.”</p>

<p>He laughed, his dark eyes appraising her slender
blond beauty eagerly.</p>

<p>“I have no quarrel with Calvin. Oatcake—by all
means. Sulphur—er—I suppose the sulphur will come
in time.”</p>

<p>“Not if you’re polite,” said the girl coolly, “and
tell me what brought you so unexpectedly to Scotland.”</p>

<p>They were standing near the fire apart from the
others, Doris with one slipper on the fender, which
she was regarding approvingly, her head upon one side.
He admired her careless tone. She was quite wonderful.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will not believe me,” he said suavely,
“if I were to tell you that I came to see you.”</p>

<p>“Me? I <em>am</em> flattered. I thought that great collectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
were always deterred by fear of the spurious.”</p>

<p>She was carrying the war into his camp. He met
the issue squarely. “They are <em>only</em> deterred by the
spurious. Therefore I am here. The inference is obvious.”</p>

<p>He had always showed the slightest trace of his
foreign accent. It went admirably with his shrug and
mobile fingers.</p>

<p>“I am genuine in this,” she laughed, “that however
much you know about pictures, about <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">objets de vertu</i>—women
must remain for you and for all other men
an unknown quantity.”</p>

<p>“Not when they are both,” he said gallantly.</p>

<p>“There are good and bad pictures—objects of virtue,
excessively ugly——”</p>

<p>“Objects of virtue are usually excessively ugly, especially
if they are women.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Doris. “You’re most flattering.
There’s something in the air of Scotland that makes
one tell the truth.”</p>

<p>He laughed. “If Scotland is as merciless as that, I
shall be off in the morning. I could imagine no worse
purgatory than a place in which one always tells the
truth. Lying is one of the highest arts of a mature
civilization. I haven’t the slightest notion, nor have
you, that either of us means a thing he says. We
were all born to deceive—some of us do it in one way,
some in another, but we all do it to the very best of
our bent. For instance, you said a while ago that it
was agreeable for you to see me. But I’m quite sure,
you know, that it wasn’t.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t agreeable if you’re going to be horrid and
cynical. Why <em>shouldn’t</em> I be glad to see you? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
always stimulate my intelligence even if you don’t flatter
it.”</p>

<p>The others had moved on to the library and they
had the room to themselves.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I could flatter it more than I have
already done,” he said in a low tone of voice.</p>

<p>She raised her chin a trifle and peered at him slantwise.</p>

<p>“Do you think that you flatter it now when you recall
the mistakes of my past?”</p>

<p>He searched her face keenly but her blue eyes met his
gaze steadily. She was smiling up at him guilelessly.</p>

<p>“A mistake—of course,” he said slowly. “You are
young enough to afford to make mistakes. But I am
old enough to wish that it hadn’t been made at my
expense.”</p>

<p>“You still care?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t thought that you wanted me for your
collection——”</p>

<p>“You are cruel——”</p>

<p>“No. I know. You wanted me for your portrait
harem, and I should have been frightfully jealous of
the Coningsby Venus. I couldn’t compete with that
sort of thing, you know.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her admiringly and went on in a low
tone.</p>

<p>“You know why I wanted you then, and why I want
you now—because you’re the cleverest woman in England,
and the most courageous.”</p>

<p>“It took courage to refuse the hand of John Rizzio.”</p>

<p>“It takes more courage in John Rizzio to hear those
words from the lips that refused him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>She laid her hand gently on his arm.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she said.</p>

<p>He bent his head and kissed her fingers.</p>

<p>“It is not the Coningsby Venus who is essential to
my happiness,” he whispered. “It’s the Doris Diana.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s the disillusionment of possession.”</p>

<p>“No. The only disillusionments of life are its failures—I
got the Venus by infinite patience. The Diana——”
He paused and drew in his breath.</p>

<p>“You think that you may get the Diana by patience
also?” she asked quietly.</p>

<p>He looked at her with a gaze that seemed to pierce
all her subterfuges.</p>

<p>“I waited for the Coningsby Venus,” he said in
measured tones, “until the man who possessed her—was
dead.”</p>

<p>She started, and the color left her cheeks.</p>

<p>“You mean—Cyril?” she stammered.</p>

<p>“I mean,” he replied urbanely, “precisely nothing—except
that I will never give you up.”</p>

<p>She recovered her poise with an effort, and when
she replied she was smiling gayly.</p>

<p>“I’m not at all sure that I want to be given up,”
she said, with a laugh that was meant to relax the
tension. “You are, after all, one of the best friends
I have.”</p>

<p>“I hope that nothing may ever happen to make you
think otherwise.”</p>

<p>Was this a threat? She glanced at him keenly as
she quoted:</p>

<p>“‘Friendship is constant in all other things save
in the office and affairs of love.’ May I trust you?”</p>

<p>“Try me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, I might put you to a test that would be difficult.”</p>

<p>“Try me.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I will. Go back to London in the morning.”</p>

<p>He looked at her and laughed.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“It will be easier for you to be patient there than
here——”</p>

<p>“When Hammersley comes?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said quickly, “then he <em>is</em> coming?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know why he shouldn’t,” he said slowly.</p>

<p>There was a pause.</p>

<p>“Shall you go?”</p>

<p>“To London? I’ll think about it.”</p>

<p>“There! You see? You refuse my first request.”</p>

<p>“I would like to know your purpose.”</p>

<p>“I think you know it already,” she put in quickly.
“You want something that I cannot give you—something
that is not mine to give.”</p>

<p>She had come out into the open defiantly and he
met her challenge with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Because it is Hammersley’s?” he said. “You think
so and Hammersley thinks so, and possession is nine
points of the law. But I will contest.”</p>

<p>“Your visit is vain. Go back to London, my
friend.”</p>

<p>“I find it pleasanter here.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse?”</p>

<p>“I must.”</p>

<p>“Then it is war between us.”</p>

<p>“If you will have it so,” he said, with an inclination
of the head. Doris put her foot on the fender and
leaned with her hands upon her knee for a moment as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
though in deep thought. Then she turned toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said coolly. “Let us join the others.”</p>

<p>There was a relief in the thought that at least they
had come to an understanding and that the matter of
the possession of the papers had at last become a
private contest between them. She had brought the
interview to an end not because she was afraid to
continue it but because she wanted to think of a plan
to disarm him. She felt that she was moving in the
dark but she trusted to her delicate woman’s sense of
touch to stumble upon some chance, some slip of his
tongue, which might lead her into the light.</p>

<p>In the drawing-room by common consent all talk of
war had been abolished. She sat in at a hand of auction,
but playing badly, she was gladly relinquished by
her partner at the end of the rubber. John Rizzio,
who disliked the game, had gone off for a quiet smoke,
but when she got up from the card table he was there
waiting for her.</p>

<p>“Cyril shall know of this,” laughed Betty, as they
went toward the door. “They say that absence makes
the heart grow fonder—of the other fellow.”</p>

<p>Doris led the way to the gun-room, a place used by
Algie Heathcote for his sporting implements and trophies
of the chase. It was comfortably furnished in
leather and oak and a cheerful fire was burning in
the grate. Doris sank into the davenport and motioned
to her companion to the place at her side. She
was thoroughly alive to her danger, but the sportswoman
in her made her keen to put it to the test.</p>

<p>“We are quite alone here,” she said coolly. “The
others are not even within call. Now what do you
want of me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Her audacity rather startled him, but he folded his
arms and leaned back smiling.</p>

<p>“The papers of Riz-la-Croix, of course,” he said
amiably.</p>

<p>“And how do you know they’re in my possession?”</p>

<p>He shrugged.</p>

<p>“Because they couldn’t possibly be anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Because I have exhausted every other resource.”</p>

<p>“You’re frank at least—including the burglary at
Ashwater Park and the messing in my box upstairs?”</p>

<p>“And since you must know the full truth,” he continued
politely, “the careful search of your room in
your absence this evening—including the removal of
the rugs and bedding. Oh, don’t be disturbed, I beg
of you,” as she made a movement of alarm, “they have
all been replaced with a nice care for detail.”</p>

<p>“And if I told Lady Heathcote of this——”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure that the best interests of all,” he
said politely, “are conserved—by silence.”</p>

<p>She meditated a moment, her gaze on the coals.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said slowly, “you’re clever—more than
ordinarily clever. I can’t understand how I could ever
have refused you. But don’t you think your methods
have been a little—er—unchivalrous?”</p>

<p>“The importance of my objects admitted of no delay.
I hope you have not been inconvenienced——”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” calmly. “My recollection of
your many civilities merely made me think that your
agents were overzealous.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he said genuinely. “It could not be
helped. You and I are merely pawns in a game greater
than anything the world has ever known.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“I didn’t want you to apologize. I merely thought
in order to avoid comment that you might have come
to me yourself.”</p>

<p>“I thought I might save you the unpleasantness of
a controversy which can only have one end.”</p>

<p>“You mean—that you will win.”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“You will give me the papers—here, tonight.”</p>

<p>“And if I told you that I had destroyed them?”</p>

<p>“That would be manifestly untrue, since at the
present moment in the position of your body their outline
is quite clearly defined on the inside of your right
knee.”</p>

<p>Doris put both slippers upon the ground, her feet
together, her face flushing warmly.</p>

<p>“I hope you will forgive my frankness,” she heard
him say gently, “but the method of your challenge—is—unusual.”</p>

<p>She clasped her hands around her knees and
frowned into the fire.</p>

<p>“You mistake, I think, my friend. It is not a challenge.
It is merely a method of defense—the safest,
I am sure, against John Rizzio.”</p>

<p>He bowed low with deep ceremony.</p>

<p>“Of course, I am helpless.” And then, “I can only
rely on your good sense and”—here his voice sunk a
note lower—“and on your loyalty to the cause of England.”</p>

<p>This was the opening that she had been waiting for.
She thrust quickly.</p>

<p>“And if the cause is England’s why didn’t Scotland
Yard come to Ashwater Park?”</p>

<p>“Dunsinane to Burnam Wood!” he shrugged. “They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
would have made asinine mistakes as they always do—the
chief of which would have been that of denouncing
Miss Doris Mather as an agent of England’s enemies.”</p>

<p>The girl tapped her toe reflectively upon the rug.</p>

<p>“I won’t attempt subterfuge. Of course, I know the
contents of that packet.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t be a woman if you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“And how it was passed from Captain Byfield to
Cyril Hammersley.” This was a random shot but it
hit the mark. Rizzio’s eyes dilated slightly, but she
saw them.</p>

<p>“Byfield! Impossible.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Cyril told me,” she lied.</p>

<p>“He told you——?” he paused aghast, for now she
was laughing at him.</p>

<p>“No—but you have.”</p>

<p>His brow tangled and he folded his arms again.</p>

<p>“Of course, you know the importance to Cyril and
Captain Byfield of keeping such a matter secret.”</p>

<p>He had not heard! He did not know! She remembered
that the subject of the dreadful news from London
had not been reopened and Jack Sandys’ sources
of information were probably semiofficial.</p>

<p>She controlled her voice with an effort.</p>

<p>“I would hardly be the one to mention names under
the circumstances—since my own fortunes seem
to be involved in the matter, but as for Captain Byfield,
I’m afraid that further secrecy will hardly help
him.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Merely that he was arrested late yesterday afternoon
as he was leaving the War Office.”</p>

<p>She had not counted on the effect she created. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
knew that her last thrust had put him more carefully
on guard, but he could not hide the sudden intake of
breath and the quick searching glance his dark eyes
shot at her.</p>

<p>“What is your source of information?”</p>

<p>“Jack Sandys. He came here directly from Downing
Street.”</p>

<p>She saw Rizzio’s lips meet under his mustache in a
thin line.</p>

<p>“So. It has come sooner—than I expected.”</p>

<p>He got up and paced the floor, his fingers twitching
behind his back. She said nothing, waiting for him
to rejoin her. When he did, it was with a serious expression.</p>

<p>“I suppose you know what this means to—to Hammersley,”
he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Doris sat without moving, but her brain was busy
weighing Rizzio.</p>

<p>“No,” she replied calmly, “I don’t. Won’t you tell
me?”</p>

<p>He leaned forward toward her along the back of
their seat, his look and voice concentrated upon her.</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” he continued, “that you haven’t
realized by this time exactly what Cyril Hammersley
is?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said staunchly. “I will believe nothing
of him unless he tells it to me himself.”</p>

<p>He waited a moment, watching her, and fancied that
he saw her lips tremble slightly. Her loyalty to Hammersley
inflamed him. He followed up his advantage
quickly.</p>

<p>“There are reasons why I should dislike to give
you pain, greater reasons why I should be generous
with a successful rival, and I have done what I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to take this matter out of your hands. There is still
time. Will you give me that packet?”</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Then I must speak,” he went on. “My duty demands
it, whatever happens to him—whatever happens
to you. Don’t make me go to extremes with you.
I cannot bear to do it. Hammersley is a German spy.
Those papers were to be forwarded to Germany. You
are saving them for him, that he may betray England.”</p>

<p>“That is not true,” she said chokingly. “I do not
believe it.”</p>

<p>“You must. Isn’t there proof enough in what you
have read?”</p>

<p>“There is some mistake.”</p>

<p>“No. There can’t be. Your sentiments are blinding
you.”</p>

<p>“One moment, please.” Doris had risen and faced
him across the hearth, a new fire of resolution in her
eyes. To Rizzio, the lover of beauty, she was a mockery
of lost happiness. She was Diana, not the huntress
but the hunted.</p>

<p>“You have told me what Cyril Hammersley is. Now
if you please I would like to know what <em>you</em> are!”</p>

<p>He paused a moment and then with a step toward
her said gently:</p>

<p>“I think my interests should be fairly obvious. I
am acting for the English Government.”</p>

<p>“I have only your word for it. Have you any papers
that would prove it—in your card-case, for instance?”</p>

<p>He started back, his fingers instinctively reaching
upward. Then he shrugged and laughed.</p>

<p>“You are surely the most amazing person. Unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
I have no documents. I am only doing
my duty as a private citizen—a loyal resident of the
Empire.”</p>

<p>“But not a Briton. Neither am I. We meet on
equal terms.”</p>

<p>“Then you refuse me—definitely, finally.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I must.”</p>

<p>“I beg that you will consider carefully the alternatives.
If you give me the papers—silence on my part—safety
for Hammersley. If you refuse to give them
up——” he paused.</p>

<p>“Then what will you do?” she defied him.</p>

<p>“It would be the most terrible moment of my life—but
I will denounce him—here tonight—tomorrow in
London. Those papers must not reach Germany—even
if I have to denounce you, too.”</p>

<p>“And if I promise that the papers will not reach
Germany?”</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>“There is too much at stake. I can’t take the risk.
No woman can be trusted——”</p>

<p>“Not even the woman John Rizzio would have made
his wife?”</p>

<p>He moved his shoulders expressively. Her youth
and cleverness were bewildering him.</p>

<p>“No, that will not do,” he said in desperation. “You
must give me the papers.”</p>

<p>“I will not. You shall have to take them from
me.”</p>

<p>He leaned toward her along the mantel aware of her
dominant loveliness.</p>

<p>“You would not drive me to that!”</p>

<p>“Yes. It <em>is</em> a challenge. I offer it. I will fight
you, and I am strong. I have a voice and I will raise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
an outcry. They will come and I will tell them. Then
you can denounce me? Will you dare?”</p>

<p>He came toward her while she fled around the davenport,
eluding him with ease. She was swifter of foot
than he. He stopped a moment near the gun-rack to
plead. She kept the huge oak lounge between them
and listened by the fire. Something she saw in his
eyes decided her, for as he came forward to leap over
the davenport she threw something yellow toward him.</p>

<p>He gave a gasp of relief, picked the object up and
made a cry of dismay.</p>

<p>“The cover! I must have the papers,” he cried,
coming forward again.</p>

<p>By this time the girl was standing upright, a poker
in one hand, the thin cigarette papers cramped in the
fingers of the other, over the open fire.</p>

<p>Rizzio paused in the very act of leaping.</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“Not that,” he whispered hoarsely, “for God’s sake—not
that.”</a></p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_82">“‘Not that,’ he whispered hoarsely, ‘for God’s

</div>

<p>“Stay where you are, then,” said the girl in a low
resolute tone.</p>

<p>Rizzio straightened. Doris still bent over the fire.</p>

<p>“Give it to me,” he said again.</p>

<p>“No. England’s secrets shall be safe.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand?” he whispered wildly. “I’ve
got to prove that they are.”</p>

<p>“I can prove that as well as you——”</p>

<p>“But you won’t. Hammersley is——”</p>

<p>He paused and both of them straightened, listening.
Outside in the hall there was a commotion and a familiar
voice as the Honorable Cyril, his face and fur coat
spattered with mud, came into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>AN INTRUDER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">He looked from one to the other with a quickly
appraising eye. The girl was fingering the
lace of her bodice. Rizzio had turned toward
the newcomer recovering his poise.</p>

<p>“Hope I’m not intrudin’,” said Hammersley, with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly. You’ve come in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” drawled Hammersley. “I missed your train,
I think. Too bad. Jolly slow work travelin’ alone.
Stryker picked me up at Edinburgh and we came
on by motor.”</p>

<p>He took off his fur coat in leisurely fashion and
crossing to the fireplace took Doris’s proffered hand.
“You had my note?” he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “I was glad,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m here. Jolly happy, too. Had a narrow
squeak of it, though. Some bally idiot stretched rope
across the road over by Saltham Rocks, but we saw it
in time, and went around. Fired a few shots at us,
too. Must have taken me for Rizzio. What?” he
laughed.</p>

<p>Thus directly appealed to, Rizzio smiled grudgingly.</p>

<p>“You don’t ask me to believe that story, Hammersley,”
he said dryly.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to, Rizzio.”</p>

<p>The girl’s look was fixed on Hammersley’s face.
Suddenly she broke in with a voice of alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cyril—you’re hurt—and there’s blood on your
coat——”</p>

<p>“Is there? By Jove, so there is—it doesn’t matter.
I wouldn’t mind a peg though—and a cigarette.”</p>

<p>Doris had started for the door in alarm.</p>

<p>“Wait!” Hammersley’s voice came sharply. And as
she paused, “Ring, Doris.”</p>

<p>She understood and touched the button beside the
door.</p>

<p>“We might as well have an understanding before
they come, Rizzio,” put in Hammersley quickly. “Do
you prefer to believe my story—or would you like
to invent one of your own?”</p>

<p>Rizzio shrugged. “As you please,” he said. “It
seems that I am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de trop</i> here.” At the door he paused
and finished distinctly. “I hope that your explanations
will prove satisfactory.”</p>

<p>Doris had helped Cyril off with his coat and by the
time the maid brought Betty Heathcote, had cut away
the sleeve of his shirt with Cyril’s pocket knife. It
was merely a gash across the upper arm, which a
bandage and some old-fashioned remedies would set
right.</p>

<p>Lady Heathcote heard the story (from which Hammersley
eliminated the rope) with amazement, and was
for sending at once for the local constabulary.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s hardly worth while,” said the Honorable
Cyril, sipping his whiskey and water, comfortably.
“Poor devils—out of work, I fancy. Wanted my
money. If they’d come to Ben-a-Chielt tomorrow
I’d give it to ’em. But I wouldn’t mind, Betty, if you
could put me up for the night. I’m not keen to be
dodgin’ bullets in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Lady Heathcote. “How extraordinary!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
I can’t understand—Saltham Rocks—that’s
on my place. Something must be done, Cyril.”</p>

<p>Hammersley yawned. “Oh, tomorrow will do.
Couldn’t catch the beggars in the dark. Besides,
it’s late. Do me a favor, Betty. Don’t let those
people come in here again. I want a word with
Doris.”</p>

<p>He had stretched himself out comfortably on the
Davenport, his eyes on the girl, who still stood uncertainly
beside him.</p>

<p>Lady Betty shrugged, and taking up her basin and
lotion moved toward the door.</p>

<p>“It’s most mysterious. Are you sure we’re quite
safe?”</p>

<p>“Quite. But I think it might be better if I had
the room between yours and Doris’s.”</p>

<p>“I was putting John Rizzio there.”</p>

<p>“Well, change—there’s a dear. And say nothing
about it. I—I might need a new dressing on this
thing in the night.”</p>

<p>She examined him curiously, but he was looking
lazily into the fire, having already taken her acquiescence
for granted.</p>

<p>When she went out, Hammersley sat up and threw
his cigarette into the fire.</p>

<p>“You have it still?” he whispered anxiously, taking
Doris by both hands.</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Thank God for that. I seemed to have arrived at
the proper moment.”</p>

<p>“I was about to burn them.”</p>

<p>He drew a long breath of relief.</p>

<p>“You know what they are?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I read them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“I was afraid you would. You have spoken to no
one.”</p>

<p>“No,” proudly. “Hardly. After what I went
through.” And, with an air of restraint, she told
him everything.</p>

<p>He listened, a serious look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“It was my fault. I should have left them in the
machine. I got away scot free.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. I saw you.”</p>

<p>“You poor child,” he said softly. “I was desperate.
I thought it necessary. How can I ever thank
you?”</p>

<p>“You can’t.” The tones of her voice were strange.</p>

<p>“I’d jolly well give my life for you, Doris. You
know that,” he said earnestly.</p>

<p>“It’s something less than that that I want, and
something more—your word of honor.”</p>

<p>“My word——?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she went on quietly. “To forswear your
German kinship and give me an oath of loyalty to
England. Difficult as it is, I’ll believe you.”</p>

<p>“Sh—!” He glanced toward the door. All the
windows of the room were closed. “He told you that
I was a German spy?” he whispered anxiously.</p>

<p>“You forget that I had proof of that already.”</p>

<p>He sat up and looked into the fire. “I hoped you
wouldn’t read ’em. It has done no good.”</p>

<p>“I have no regrets. I will not betray England, Cyril,
even for you.”</p>

<p>He rose and paced the rug in front of her for a
moment. Then he spoke incredulously in a whisper.</p>

<p>“You mean that you won’t give ’em to me?”</p>

<p>“I mean that—precisely.”</p>

<p>“But that is impossible,” he went on, with greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
signs of excitement than she had ever seen in him.
“Don’t you realize now that every moment the things
are in your possession you’re in danger—great danger?
Isn’t what you’ve gone through—isn’t this”—and
he indicated his arm—“the proof of it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said firmly. “But I would rather suffer
injury myself than see you share the fate of Captain
Byfield.”</p>

<p>He started. “Oh, you heard that?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Jack Sandys is here.” She put her face in
her hands in the throes of her doubts of him and then
suddenly thrust out her hands and laced her fingers
around his arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, give it up, Cyril, for my sake give it all up.
Can’t you see the terrible position you’ve placed me in?
If I give these papers to Jack Sandys they’ll come and
take you as they took Captain Byfield. I’ve kept them
for you, because I promised. But I cannot let this
information get to Germany. I would die first. What
shall I do?” she wailed. “What on earth <em>can</em> I do?”</p>

<p>His reply made her gasp.</p>

<p>“There’s a fire,” he said quietly. “Burn ’em.”</p>

<p>Her fingers went to her corsage and her eyes gleamed
with a new hope. She took the crumpled rice-papers
out and looked at them. Then in a flash the thought
came to her.</p>

<p>“You know the information contained in these papers?”
she asked in an accent of deprecation.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied shortly. “I merely glanced at
them.”</p>

<p>“You hadn’t the chance to study them?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>Still she hesitated. “But what—what is Rizzio?”</p>

<p>He walked to the door of the room, opening it suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Then he shut it quietly and coming back to
the fire took the poker and made a hole between the
glowing coals.</p>

<p>“Burn ’em!” he commanded.</p>

<p>She obeyed him wonderingly and together they
watched the package of rice-papers flame into a live
coal and then turn to ashes. When the last vestige of
them had disappeared, they sat together on the davenport,
Cyril thoughtful, the girl bewildered.</p>

<p>“What is Rizzio?” she repeated. “He told me that
he was an agent of the English Government.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you,” he whispered hoarsely. “I can’t
tell you anything—even you. Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. It’s your word against his. I would
rather believe you than him. I want to, Cyril. God
knows I want to.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t I ask you to burn the papers? Didn’t he
try to prevent it?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you see? If he were acting for England,
it wouldn’t matter what became of ’em if they didn’t
reach Germany.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I thought of that—but what you have told
me bewilders me. Why should you run away with secrets
of England—given you by a traitor who is about
to pay the penalty with—with death? What does it
mean? Why didn’t you take those papers at once to
the War Office? Why did Captain Byfield give them
to you? He—a traitor—to you—Cyril! It is all so
horrible. I am frightened. Your danger—Rizzio’s
men, here—tonight—all about us.”</p>

<p>“If they were English secret service men,” Cyril
put in quietly, “wouldn’t they come here to this house
and arrest me in the name of the law?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes. There must be other reasons why they can’t.
What is the contest between you and Rizzio? Tell
me. Tell me everything! I will believe you. Haven’t
I kept your trust? If I could do that—for your sake—do
you not think that I could keep silent for England’s
sake?”</p>

<p>Her arms were about his neck, and her lips very
close to his, but he turned his head away so that the
temptation might not be too strong for him.</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he muttered, “I cannot speak—even to
you. I am sworn to secrecy.”</p>

<p>She drooped upon his arms and then moved away
despairingly. It was the failure of the appeal of her
femininity that condemned him.</p>

<p>“Oh, you won’t let me believe in you. You won’t let
me. It’s too great a test you’re asking of me. Everything
is against you—but the worst witness is your
silence!”</p>

<p>He stood by the mantel, his head lowered.</p>

<p>“It is hard for you—hard for us both,” he said
softly, “but I can’t tell you anythin’—anythin’.” He
raised his head and looked at her with pity. She had
sunk upon the divan, her head upon her arms in a despair
too deep for tears.</p>

<p>He crossed and laid his hand gently upon her shoulder.</p>

<p>“You must trust in me if you can. I will try to
be worthy of it. That’s all I can say.” He paused.
“And now you must go to bed. You’re a bit fagged.
Perhaps in the mornin’ you’ll pull up a bit and see
things differently.”</p>

<p>She straightened slowly and their eyes met for a
moment. His never wavered, and she saw that they
were very kind, but she rose silently and without offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
him her lips or even her hand, moved slowly toward
the door.</p>

<p>He reached it in a stride before her and put his
hand upon the knob.</p>

<p>“There’s one thing more I’ve got to ask.”</p>

<p>Her look questioned.</p>

<p>“You must sleep in my room tonight, next to Betty’s.
I shall sleep in yours.”</p>

<p>Her weary eyes sought his with an effort.</p>

<p>“You mean you think Rizzio—would still——?”</p>

<p>She paused.</p>

<p>“Yes, he thinks you would not give them to me.”
And then, with a laugh, “You wouldn’t, you know.”</p>

<p>“And if I tell him I have burned them——”</p>

<p>“He will not believe you.”</p>

<p>“He would not believe me,” she repeated in a daze.</p>

<p>“You must do what I ask,” Cyril went on quietly. “I
know what is best. I’ll arrange it with Betty.” He
glanced at his watch. “One o’clock. By Jove! It’s
time even for auction players.”</p>

<p>She promised him at last after a protest on his
own account.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ to worry about,” he laughed. “They may
not try anythin’, and when they find I’m there they’ll
bundle out in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Thus reassured she went out to the drawing-room
where the card players were just rising. Rizzio was
nowhere to be seen. Cyril at once took their hostess
aside and told her that Doris was a little upset by
the shooting, asking if Betty would mind letting her
take the room next to her own, so that she could open
the door between.</p>

<p>“Don’t say anything about it, Betty,” he urged.
“Just ask her in, won’t you, when you get upstairs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I could do a turn on steel spikes,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Your arm?”</p>

<p>“Right as rain. It’s nothing at all.”</p>

<p>Doris accepted the situation without a word. Indeed
she was numbed with the fatigue of strained
nerves. The swift rush of incident since Betty’s London
dinner, with its rapid alternations of hope and
fear, had left her bewildered and helpless. But it
was the interview with Cyril tonight that had plunged
her into the dark abyss of despair. She had tried so
hard to believe in him, but he would do nothing to take
away the weight that had been dragging her down further
and further from the light. A new kind of love
had come to her, born of the new Cyril who had won
her over by the sheer force of a personality, the existence
of which she had not dreamed. A short time
ago she had wanted to see him awake—a firebrand—and
she had had her wish, for she had kindled to his
touch like tinder. But tonight, in her utter weariness,
it seemed as though her spirit was charred, burnt
to a cinder, like the package of papers in the grate
in the gun-room, destroyed, as the secret message had
been, in the great game that Cyril was playing.</p>

<p>She undressed slowly, listening for any sounds that
might come from the room next door, but the only sign
she had of him was the familiar smell of his pipe tobacco
which came through the cracks and key-hole. A
little later Betty Heathcote came in prepared for what
she called a “back hair talk,” but found her guest so
unresponsive that at last she went into her own room
and bed. Doris lay for a while watching the line of
light under Cyril’s door, wondering what he was doing
and what the night was to bring forth. One memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
persisted in the chaos of the night’s events. Cyril
didn’t know the contents of the papers and yet he
had commanded her to burn them. The thought
quieted her, and at last she saw the light in his room
go out, then, after a time, in spite of her weariness,
she slept.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She awakened, trembling with terror, listening for
she knew not what. And then as her wits slowly came
to her, she was aware of the sounds which had awakened
her. They were suppressed, secret, and strange,
but none the less terrible, the shuffling of feet, hoarse
whispers, and the creaking of straining furniture. She
sat upright, slipped to the floor quickly, and, getting
into the dressing-gown at the foot of the bed, stood
for a moment in the middle of the room, her heart beating
wildly. Then with quick resolution she moved
swiftly to Betty Heathcote’s room and, after assuring
herself that her hostess still slept, closed the door
softly and passed the bolt.</p>

<p>Again she hesitated. The sounds from Cyril’s room
continued, the hard breathing of men who seemed with
one accord to be trying to keep their struggles silent.
Aware of her danger, but considering it less than the
physical need for immediate action, with trembling fingers
she turned the key and quickly opened the door.</p>

<p>At first, silence, utter and profound, but full of a
terror which a breath might reveal.</p>

<p>“Cyril! What is it?” she managed to whisper.</p>

<p>“Sh—” she heard. And dimly, in the pale moonlight,
she made out the dark blur of figures upon the
floor in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>“Cyril!” she repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s all right,” she heard in a breathless whisper.
“Go back to your room. It’s nothin’.”</p>

<p>But having ventured thus far she did not hesitate,
and closing the door behind her came forward. Upon
the floor, half against the wall, was the figure of a
man. Cyril was sitting on his legs and holding him
with one hand by the neck cloth.</p>

<p>“You’re safe?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes. Go back to bed. Don’t you understand—if
anyone came——?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care.” Her curiosity had triumphed. She
leaned forward and saw that it was John Rizzio.</p>

<p>“Rizzio!” she whispered. “My room!”</p>

<p>“I ought to kill him, Doris,” said Cyril savagely,
“but I’ve only choked him a little. He’ll come around
in a minute.” And then more quietly: “Get me a
glass of water, but don’t make a fuss, and don’t make
a light. There are men outside.”</p>

<p>She obeyed, and in a moment Rizzio revived and sat
up, Cyril standing over him, his fist clenched.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him go, Cyril, please,” Doris pleaded.</p>

<p>At the sound of the girl’s voice Rizzio started and
with Cyril’s help struggled to his feet.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s going the way he came—by the window,”
growled Hammersley. “Head first, if I have my way.”</p>

<p>Rizzio succeeded in a smile, though he was still
struggling for breath.</p>

<p>“I suppose—I—I must thank you for your generosity,
Hammersley,” he said with as fine a return of his
composure as his throat permitted. “I have been
guilty of—of an error in judgment——”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you think it’s only that,” said Cyril dryly.
“Now go,” he whispered threateningly, pointing to the
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“In a moment—with your permission,” he said, recovering
his suavity with his breath. “In extenuation
of this visit, terrible as it seems to Miss Mather, I—I
can only say that if I had succeeded I would have
saved her from remembering some day that she had
given England’s secrets into the hands of the enemy.”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken,” said Doris quietly. “I have
burned them.”</p>

<p>“You—you burned them?”</p>

<p>“Yes—tonight.”</p>

<p>Rizzio peered at her in silence for a long moment
and then shrugged. “Oh,” he said, “in that case, I
have made two errors in judgment——”</p>

<p>“You’ll make a third, if you’re not out of that window
in half a second,” said Cyril.</p>

<p>But Rizzio laughed at him.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it would be wise to make a disturbance——”
he said coolly. “I think Miss Mather will
admit my generosity to herself and to you when I say
that I’ve only to raise my voice and have half a dozen
men up here in a moment.”</p>

<p>Doris clutched him fearfully by the arm, thinking
of Cyril.</p>

<p>“You’d not do that——?”</p>

<p>Hammersley laughed dryly.</p>

<p>“There’s no danger,” he said.</p>

<p>“No,” returned Rizzio with a touch of his old magnificence.
“There is no danger of that—the reasons
are obvious.”</p>

<p>As he moved toward the window Hammersley
touched him lightly on the arm.</p>

<p>“I warn you, Rizzio,” he said in a low concentrated
tone, “that you’re playing a dangerous hand. I should
punish you—but other agencies——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Rizzio halted. “Yes, other agencies——” he replied
significantly. He bowed in the girl’s direction and sitting
on the window-sill he threw his feet outside. “I
bid you good night.” And carefully feeling for his
footing he slowly descended.</p>

<p>Cyril Hammersley followed him to the window, and
Doris took a step in his direction, when her thinly
slippered foot touched something in the wooden floor—something
which slid upon the polished surface from
the shadow into the moonlight. Instinctively she
glanced down and then started—scarcely restraining a
gasp. There, unmistakable in the shape and color for
so many hours graven on her mind, was a yellow packet
of Riz-la-Croix cigarette papers. She glanced at Cyril,
who was closing the casement window, then stooped
and, picking up the packet, fled noiselessly into her
room and quickly locked the door.</p>

<small>EVIDENCE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Inside her own room she stood for a moment
tremulously in the dark, fingering the guilty
thing in her hands as she had fingered the other
one—the one she had destroyed. Or hadn’t she destroyed
it? For a moment the thought came to her
that Cyril had practiced some trick upon her when
they had knelt before the fire, substituting other papers
for the ones that were to be burned. But that
was impossible. The papers had not touched his fingers.
He it was who had made a hole for them in the
fire, but her fingers had thrust the original papers into
the glowing coals. She turned the packet over and
over in her fingers, glancing at the closed door that
separated her from Cyril. Another message! It
must be.</p>

<p>She pulled the curtains at the window and then moving
quietly to the bed, lit the candle on the night-stand.
Another packet of Riz-la-Croix, new like the
other, with its tiny thin rubber band. She opened it
quickly and scanned its pages, finding what she sought
without difficulty. The writing was not in the same
hand. It was rounder and less minute, covering in all
seven pages, and it was written carelessly as if the
writer had been in a hurry. Cyril’s own handwriting
it seemed. The purport of its message was the
same.</p>

<p>No. She remembered the dates. These were somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
different. The names of the regiments were the
same, but the dates instead of days in April and May
gave days in the months of June and July. And the
numerals which at first had puzzled her were smaller.
For instance, among “Highland Regiments Foot” the
numerals of which she remembered particularly, instead
of 120,000 she saw the numerals 42,000. It was
the same under other headings in the remainder of the
items. Under “shrapnel” there were changes, and
under “artillery”——</p>

<p>She closed the packet in icy fingers, for the figures
swam before her eyes. They were all true—all the
horrible things that she had thought of Cyril! This
was later and more accurate information—the exact
reason for which she did not pretend to understand—and
was intended to follow the previous message—perhaps
to be used as a code in connection with it.
Cyril was—— Oh, the dishonor of it! And she had
gone to sleep almost ready to believe in him again—because
he had let her burn the other papers. What
did it matter to him whether she burned the papers
when he had other messages to send and had committed
to memory the facts he had let her destroy?
He had lied to her. He was false as Judas and more
dangerous, for now she knew that he was desperate as
well as cunning, stooping to any means, no matter
how ignoble, to gain his ends. She had been a mere
bauble in his hands, a child upon whose credulity he
had played without scruple. He had used her, the
woman he had said he loved, for his own unworthy
ends as he used Betty Heathcote and her house. She
was filled with shame for him and for herself, who could
love something shameful.</p>

<p>And John Rizzio! Rizzio, Cyril’s enemy, stood for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
England and right, and she had permitted herself to
see through Cyril’s eyes just as Cyril had wanted her
to see.</p>

<p>It seemed as she compared them that Rizzio’s nobility
attained a firmer contour. He had come to her
room to save her from her own ignorance and wilfulness,
from committing a crime, the greatest of all
crimes against England. Rizzio knew what Cyril was
and on her account had refrained from giving Cyril
up to the officers of the law, although they were within
call—even when he felt himself yielding to the fury of
Cyril’s superior physical strength. Not even the spirit
of revenge for the punishment Cyril had given him,
not even the humiliation he had suffered before her
eyes had been enough to make him forget his intention
to save, if he could, for the woman who loved him, a
successful rival. And she, Doris, had stood by Cyril’s
side warm in Cyril’s cause, against the one man who
held Cyril’s fate as the bearer of treacherous messages,
in his hand.</p>

<p>There was still danger in the air. The last words
of the two men to each other had been hidden threats
of “other agencies,” whatever they were, and she found
herself praying in a whisper that the agency of England,
even if it meant Cyril’s danger, might conquer.
O God! It would have been better, it seemed, if the
bullet at Saltham Rocks that had grazed Cyril’s arm
had killed him. That death would at least have been
free from the shame of that which awaited Captain
Byfield.</p>

<p>She gazed with wide eyes at her guttering candle.
She was wishing for Cyril’s death! She shivered with
pity for herself and for him and huddled down in the
bed, a very small, very miserable object, seeking in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
vain some hope, some rest for her mind amid the torture
of her thoughts.</p>

<p>Suddenly she started up and sat clutching the yellow
packet to her breast, her gaze fixed on the door into
Cyril’s room. Had she heard a knock? Or was it
only imagination? Yes. There it was again. She
leaned over hurriedly and blew out the candle and lay
very still, her teeth chattering with the cold, her body
trembling. He was knocking again, a little louder
this time, and she heard his voice through the keyhole
whispering her name. She made no response and
feigned sleep. He knocked again still louder and she
heard her name spoken quite distinctly. He would
awaken the house if this went on. When he knocked
again she got up and went over to the door.</p>

<p>“Doris!” he was saying.</p>

<p>She answered him.</p>

<p>“Will you open the door—just a crack?”</p>

<p>“No,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“You cannot.”</p>

<p>“Please.”</p>

<p>“I’m listening. What do you want to say?”</p>

<p>“I’ve lost something—something that must have
fallen from my pocket.”</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>And then in quick anxious tones:</p>

<p>“You didn’t see—anythin’—on the floor by the
door?”</p>

<p>“No,” she lied, trembling. “I didn’t.”</p>

<p>She heard him mutter.</p>

<p>“You’re sure?” came his voice again.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>And then in dubious tones:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, very well then. Sorry to have troubled you.
Good night.”</p>

<p>She didn’t reply and stole back through the darkness
to her bed, into which she crept, like some thin
wraith of vengeance, biding her time.</p>

<p>Into bed, but not to sleep. She watched the moonlight
grow pale into the west and saw the first gray
streaks of dawn paint the wooded slopes of Ben Darrah
across the valley of the Dorth. In pity for herself
and Cyril she watched the new day born, a new
day, bleak and cheerless, which seemed by its very
aspect to pronounce a sentence upon them; the new
day which was to mark the passing of all the things
growing womanhood holds most dear, her first faith,
her first tenderness, her first passion.</p>

<p>Doris kept to her room until Betty came in, awakening
her from a heavy sleep into which she had fallen
just before sunrise. Lady Heathcote rang for Wilson
and then retired to the ministrations of her own maid,
leaving Doris to dress for the morning at her leisure.
And when the girl got downstairs to breakfast she
found that the other guests had preceded her. But
Betty Heathcote was still in the breakfast room picking
with dainty fingers at the various dishes upon the
sideboard and making sparkling comment as was her
custom on men and things. She found the disappearance
of John Rizzio, bag, baggage and man, from Kilmorack
House without even a line to his hostess both
unusual and surprising, since her guest was a man who
made much of the amenities and forms of proper behavior.
Doris commented in a desultory way, trying
to put on an air of cheerfulness, aware of Cyril Hammersley
somewhere in the background awaiting the
chance to speak to her alone. She did not hurry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
when Betty arose sauntered into the library where the
other guests were waiting for the horses to come
around. Twice Cyril tried to speak to her, but she
avoided him skillfully, contriving to be a part of a
group where personal topics were not to be discussed.
That kind of maneuvering she knew was a game at
which any woman is more than a match for any man.
But she saw by the cloud that was growing in Cyril’s
eyes that he was not in the mood to be put off with
excuses, and realized that the sooner the pain of their
interview was over, the better it would be for both of
them. She was dressed in the long coat and breeches
which she wore in the hunting field, and in her waistcoat
pocket was the yellow packet.</p>

<p>“I’ve got to see you for half an hour alone,” he
said at last, taking the bull by the horns.</p>

<p>“I shall miss my ride.”</p>

<p>“They’re taking the long road to Ben-a-Chielt. I’ll
take you there in the motor and send your mount on
by a groom.”</p>

<p>She acquiesced with a cool shrug which put him at
once upon his guard, but Doris had reached a pass
when all she wanted was to bring their relations to an
end as speedily and with as little pain as possible.
So that when the others had gone she sank into a chair
before the fire, coldly asking him what he wanted. He
stood with his back to the hearth, his hands clasped
behind him, in a long moment of silence as though trying
to find the words to begin.</p>

<p>“Well?” she asked insolently.</p>

<p>“What has happened since last night to change you
so, Doris?”</p>

<p>“I’ve had a chance to think.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“That it was time you and I had an understanding.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see——”</p>

<p>“Wait!” she commanded, with a wave of the hand.
“There isn’t anything that you can say that will make
me change my mind. Therefore the sooner this talk
is over the better for both of us. I’ve told you and
you know already that my whole soul is wrapped in
the cause of England in this war. I can have nothing
but pity and contempt for any Englishman——”</p>

<p>She paused, for at this moment, the parlor maid
appeared and, gathering up some brasses on Lady
Heathcote’s desk, went out of the room.</p>

<p>“I beg that you will be more careful, Doris,” Cyril
whispered.</p>

<p>She was silent a moment, and then after a glance at
the dining-room door, went on with more restraint.</p>

<p>“Pity and contempt are hardly the kind of ingredients
that love can live on. They’ve poisoned mine.
It’s dead. I don’t want to see you again,” she finished
coldly—“ever. I hope you understand.”</p>

<p>He bowed his head and for a moment made no reply.</p>

<p>“I asked——” he said slowly, “I hoped—that you
would be willin’ to trust me—that you’d wait until I
was able to speak to you—to explain the—the things
you do not understand.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” she put in distinctly, “there is
nothing that I do not understand. I know—God help
you!—what you are. I have done what I can to save
you from the fate you’re courting—and I shall still do
so, for the sake of—of what once was—was between
us. But I do not want to see you again. I have put
you out of my life—completely—as though you never
had been in it. And now,” she rose, “will you let
me go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“One moment, please,” he said calmly. “You found
those papers last night?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said coolly. “And if I did?”</p>

<p>He seemed to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said quickly, “I’m glad of that. You
don’t deny——?”</p>

<p>“I deny nothing,” he said with a shrug. “I see that
it would be useless.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you give me credit for that much intelligence,”
she said scathingly. “You haven’t done so
before.”</p>

<p>“It was not your intelligence,” he said gently, “so
much as your heart that I had relied upon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you thought I was a fool that you could use—indefinitely——”</p>

<p>“No. I thought you were a woman that I could
count on indefinitely.”</p>

<p>Something in the tone of his own voice made her
turn and look at him.</p>

<p>“A woman—yes, but not an enemy of England.”</p>

<p>He was silent again, and when he spoke it was not
to argue. His voice was subdued—shamed even it
seemed.</p>

<p>“And now—I suppose you will give the—the papers
to Sandys,” he said.</p>

<p>She examined him closely and pity for him seemed
even stronger than shame.</p>

<p>“It is a part of our misunderstanding,” she said
coolly, “that you should think so little of me. I have
told you that I shall protect you. My hands shall be
clean, if my heart isn’t.”</p>

<p>“What will you do with the papers?” he asked.</p>

<p>“This,” and she turned toward him—“burn them.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
She put her hand into her pocket, drew out the papers
and went toward the hearth. Her hand was even extended
toward the fire when, with a quick movement,
he snatched the yellow packet from her fingers.</p>

<p>She fell away from him in dismay, as if she had been
touched by something poisonous, touching her wrist
and the fingers into which her rings had been driven.
Then she hid her face in her hands and closed her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped. “You’d pay my generosity—with
<em>this</em>!”</p>

<p>He had examined the papers coolly and had put
them into his pocket.</p>

<p>“I? I don’t count in a game like this—nor do you.
I’m sorry. They were mine. You took them. I had
to have them.”</p>

<p>“Then <em>this</em>——” she stammered, “<em>this</em> was what you
kept me here for?”</p>

<p>“I had to have them,” he repeated dully. That was
all. Her wrist and fingers burned where he had hurt
them. A brute—a coward—as well as a traitor. She
straightened proudly and with a look at his bowed
head, she went by him and out of the room.</p>

<p>Hammersley stood as she had left him for a moment
and only raised his head when the parlor maid came in
again and replaced the brasses on Lady Heathcote’s
desk. In his eyes there came a keen look and he took
a step forward.</p>

<p>“Do you always clean Lady Heathcote’s brasses on
Friday?” he asked the maid.</p>

<p>She turned around with a startled air.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir,” she replied demurely. “Friday, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Hammersley. “Thanks.”</p>

<p>She stood a moment as if awaiting further questions
and then went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Hammersley followed her with his gaze and then
with a last look around the room went into the hall, put
on his fur coat and cap and quickly made his way toward
the garage.</p>

<p>Upstairs Doris paced her room in an agony of rage
and humiliation. She had meant to give him his dismissal
kindly, but it was his abjectness that had made
her scornful—abjectness worn as she now knew with
an object that was indifferent to scorn. It was only
with the purpose of getting the papers from her that
he had kept her there, and the contempt that she had
shown for him seemed but a piteous thing beside the
enormity of his brutality. He had not cared what
she thought of him. He had not cared. He had said
so himself. Their love was a trifle beside the greater
matter that concerned him.</p>

<p>He had led her on under the guise of a shame he did
not feel, from one revelation to another, playing upon
her emotions, upon things, which should have been
sacred even to him in such an hour until with infinite
cunning he had made her bring out the papers—and
then——</p>

<p>Rage possessed her. She felt that she had been
tricked—with weapons that he should have scorned to
use. She hated him at that moment, not as she hated
the secrecy and dishonor of his cause, but as a man
who could take advantage of a woman, as a hypocrite,
a coward, a bully.</p>

<p>She knew the fury of Dido, but she felt the pain of
Ariadne too. She heard the sound of his roadster and
ran to the window, peering dark-eyed through the muslin
curtains, and saw him go by under her windows,
low down in his seat, his gaze fixed on the road ahead,
driving fast, Stryker beside him. He passed without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
even a glance upward or back—out of her life. It
seemed to her that if he had turned his head just then
and given one look at the house even, she could have
forgiven him much, but she watched him until he turned
the angle of the road and was gone.</p>

<p>Their interview had seemed so brief—in all it seemed
scarcely more than a moment—to have made such a
horrible change in her way of looking at things. If
he had protested innocence, fought, if even so weakly,
against her evidence, fought with a man’s strength
against odds the danger of losing the woman he wanted,
she could have seen him go with a calmness born of
woman’s inherent right to dismiss. But this——!
Death surely was no worse than for a woman to be
spurned by such a man.</p>

<p>After a while tears came, and they helped her, tears
of anger, if you will, but tears, soft and humid, in
which to a woman there is always a kind of bitter
sweetness, too. She threw herself on her bed in her
riding togs, her mannish coat and mannish boots, eloquent
of their own pretensions. In spite of them and
the things they typified she was merely a very tired
little girl, weeping her heart out as other little girls
had done before and will again, because her lover had
gone away from her.</p>

<p>Toward luncheon time when the others were expected
to return she got up, bathed her eyes and, summoning
Wilson, changed into a dress for the afternoon. Pride
came to her rescue now, and with the help of her maid
and the mysterious process with which maids are familiar
she managed to make herself presentable enough
to avoid notice from so keen an observer as her hostess.
Doris found herself smiling, and doing her share of
conversation in a mechanical way which left a question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in her mind as to the depth of her own emotions.
But the weight about her heart, the dull echo of reiterated
thoughts pervaded all and she knew that it
was merely that her spirit was dulled, her heart numb,
like a nerve from the shock of a blow. She stole away
when she could with a book to the gun-room, where
she could sit alone and try to put her thoughts in
order.</p>

<small>THE VIKING’S TOWER</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There in the middle of the afternoon the butler
brought her a note. For a moment before
she read the superscription, a wild rush of
something which might have been joy yet could not be,
sent a pale flush of color into her cheek. But she
glanced at the envelope carelessly, and when the man
had gone, quickly opened it.</p>

<p>It was from John Rizzio, signed with the familiar
initials and begun without either name or qualification:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>You will think it strange, perhaps, that I should
write to you after the events of last night, because
the modesty of a woman is the last thing that forgives.
My action is beyond apology and I offer
none for fear that it may be construed into a hope—a
selfish hope of an unimaginable forgiveness.
Hope has passed—that with the others, but something
else remains, something less selfish than hope
and more vital than self-interest and that is a whole-hearted
wish that your honor may be kept free
from the taint of the dark and furtive things with
which it has come into contact.</p>

<p>I am not a man, as you know, to boast of disinterestedness.
I have lived a life in which my own
affairs were always paramount, my own aims always
most important. I am telling you this to warn you
that my generosity to Hammersley is not actuated
by any love of a man who has spoiled my dearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
ambition, but by the continued esteem with which I
still regard yourself. I do not love him; and my
own wish, my duty, my own honor, my loyalty to
England all acclaim that he should be delivered at
once to those in authority. And yet I have refrained—for
you, Doris. But I have learned that H——
is in communication with G—— and that Crenshaw
of Scotland Yard is on the alert. I may not be able
to save him.</p>

<p>This is an appeal to the one person who has the
most influence with him and I ask that you use whatever
power over him you possess to bring him to
a sense of the impossibility of his mad plans. If
you still have doubt as to the character of the work
he has undertaken, I ask that you go to Ben-a-Chielt
tonight and listen secretly to convincing proof of
what he is. For tonight at one o’clock on the cliffs
near the old Viking’s Tower, he will meet a personal
messenger from G——.</p>

<p>I appeal to you for England—but more than for
England, for—yourself.</p>

<p class="padr7">Yours,</p>

<p class="right">J. R.</p>
</div>

<p>Doris read the note through again and again, her
thoughts blurring unpleasantly, like a photograph out
of focus. It seemed impossible that she could do what
he asked of her. Every instinct, wounded and sore
from her last encounter, revolted at the thought of
meeting Cyril again under the conditions presented.
It was impossible that she should go. Cyril would
only laugh at her or, what would be worse, show her
the callousness and brutality that he had done this
morning. Rizzio asked her to do what she could.
Why should she save him? What had he done to
merit such a sacrifice of pride on her part. The past?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
That was dead and Cyril buried with it. England?
She put her head forward into her hands and pressed
her fingers to her temples. England!</p>

<p>As the afternoon faded into night the conviction
grew in Doris’s mind that the situation made personal
considerations unimportant. After dinner she excused
herself and, dressing warmly, toward twelve o’clock
went downstairs past the library door and out to the
stables. She found a sleepy groom and, giving him a
liberal fee as the price of his silence, had a side-saddle
put on a good horse and made her way in the direction
of Ben-a-Chielt. She knew the road well, for she had
traveled it many times with Cyril and Betty during
the previous summer when all the world was gay and
she and Cyril were lovers. She was a little nervous
at being alone on the moor in the darkness, but not
frightened. She gave herself greater hardihood by
trying to remember that Cyril and Rizzio were gentlemen,
one of whom she had thought she could have
trusted with her life, the other a friend who wanted to
be trusted with it—and now protested he held her
honor dearer than his own. Not her enemies surely;
and the thought of physical harm from either of them,
the only thing that could have deterred her from this
midnight venture, did not occur to her. But as she
came to Saltham Rocks, the scene of Cyril’s last night’s
encounter, she pressed forward more rapidly with a
keen eye upon the gray blur of the road. She reached
the cross-roads, her breath coming a little more rapidly,
pulled her horse down to a walk and turned in
upon Cyril’s property, going forward more slowly.
Until the present moment she had formulated no plan
of action, nor had counted upon the possibilities of
discovery, so she rode cautiously, making a long detour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
across the moor to avoid the lights of one of the
keepers’ houses which stood upon the road. She found
that she had to choose her way among the rocks and
whins, but her horse was sure-footed, and at a walk
there was little danger of a cropper. She kept the
road in sight and by the fitful light of the stars, between
the rack of mist and clouds that were coming
in from the sea, she made her way in the general direction
of the Lodge. On her right she had glimpses
of the sea beyond the cliffs and heard the pounding of
the surf upon the rocks and shingle. The Viking’s
Tower was up among the rocks near Beaufort Head,
half a mile beyond the house. She had been there with
Cyril many times, and from the ruined wall had sat
with him and looked out over the North Sea, while he
had told her in his sportive vernacular the story of
the tower and of the “Johnnies” who had built it. It
was difficult to identify that Cyril now with the man
of mystery lurking out here somewhere in the dark,
his mind set on the odious business of betraying his
country.</p>

<p>The Lodge was set inland from the sea in a valley
between two ridges which narrowed down to a fissure
in the rocks that fell away to Beaufort Cove, a small
harbor almost land-locked where Cyril kept his motor-boats
and sloop. As the girl approached the Lodge,
she turned far to the left and made a wide circle
among the hills, so that there could be no chance of
inquisitive eyes discovering the bold silhouette of her
horse against the sky. Slowly she climbed the lower
ridges of Ben-a-Chielt until she reached a level spot,
high above the house, garage, stables and hangar,
where she stopped for a moment to rest her winded
horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Below her a wild panorama of land and wind-blown
sky, the ragged profile of black rocks etched deep into
the sullen gray of the sea. Seen from this height the
contours were unfamiliar to her and the purpose of
her grim visit gave the grim vista a dramatic significance
that was almost theatrical. Long lines emerged
from the dark blur of sea and sky and roared in upon
the rocks that guarded the harbor upon which they
were shivered into foam. Inside the rim of rocks the
placid cove calmly reflected the sky. She saw the
motor-boats near the landing, made out the specter
lines of Cyril’s sloop, the <i>Windbird</i>, and in the shadow
of the cliffs saw another vessel, the lines of which were
unfamiliar. This craft was long and slender with a
wireless mast and two large smoke-stacks. No lights
showed aboard of her, but there were signs of activity,
for while the girl looked a small boat was lowered and
was pulled for the landing; and suddenly the real
meaning of this dark vessel was borne to her. There
was no mistaking the grim profile of the thing that
projected from the forward superstructure and the
curving decks which met the water in such slender
lines. It was a war-vessel, a destroyer, and the man
who was putting out for the shore was the German
messenger who was to meet Cyril Hammersley at Ben-a-Chielt.
She trembled and clung to the pommel of her
saddle. The brief joyous moments that had come to
her at intervals during the evening as she thought of
the inflections of Cyril’s voice, of the weary look she
had seen in his eyes, and hoped that even tonight he
might be able to justify himself in her own thoughts at
least were engulfed in the damning conviction of what
she saw before her. John Rizzio had told her the truth.
How he had learned what was to happen, she did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
know or care, but the accuracy of his information was
no longer a matter to doubt.</p>

<p>She looked around her in the darkness toward the
way by which she had come, really frightened for the
first time that evening as at the palpable presence of
sin. For a moment she hesitated in her intention to
go forward. She had seen enough to convince her.
There was no need of more. But the real object of her
mission nerved her to her task. She must go on at
once if she wished to reach the Tower in time to conceal
herself. So she pressed her horse along the hill,
and when she had crossed the ridge rode down in a
path parallel to the edge of the cliffs, which brought
her after a while into a line with Beaufort Head, where
she could see the dim mass of the ruin rising above the
chaos of rock that surrounded it.</p>

<p>When she reached a spot not too far distant, she
dismounted in a clump of bushes and fastening the
bridle of her horse to the gnarled limb of a stunted
tree, crept forward on foot. The excitement of the
venture and its possible consequences now gave her
renewed strength and caution. Moving to the left,
toward the northern side of the Tower, she clambered
over the rocks toward the sea. There should be plenty
of time to reach a place of concealment before the
occupant of the boat had time to climb the steep and
tortuous path from the landing, and peering from side
to side, pausing from time to time to listen, she reached
the shadow of Table Rock, a huge slab of granite
which had been tossed by some convulsion of Nature
upon the very summit of the Head. The physical contours
of the place made her approach an easy one, for
the cliffs were strewn with bowlders and it was easy to
slip from one to another without detection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Assured that the spot that she had reached was as
near the Tower as she dared approach for the present,
she wedged herself into a crevice between two rocks,
into which she might pass and go out by the other side,
and sank down upon her knees and waited. The moments
passed slowly. Where was John Rizzio? Would
Cyril never come? She had a moment of horror in the
thought that the German messenger might come and
discover her before Cyril arrived. What would he do
to her? Kill her, of course. And in a panic of sinking
nerves she thought of getting to her feet and fleeing
into the friendly darkness from which she had come.
She had even risen and her head was just below the
level of the top of her refuge when she heard footsteps
close by and got the odor of a cigarette. So she sank
back, her hand at her heart to quiet its throbbings.</p>

<p>The footsteps passed her, returned and then went
toward the Tower and she bared her head and peered
cautiously out. A tall figure in a long coat and deer-stalker
cap was standing watching the path to the
landing. She could not see his features, but she knew
that it was Cyril. For one moment she thought of
running to him and throwing herself at his feet and
pleading with him while there was still time to go away
into the darkness—with her—anywhere before this
stranger should reach him. But her courage failed
her and she sank back into her corner. And when
she straightened again her moment had passed, for she
heard other footsteps to her right of a man as he clambered
up the rocks. He passed quite near her, a burly
man in a naval cap and coat, out of breath from his
exertions.</p>

<p>Cyril came forward to meet him, and she heard the
short words of their greeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Herr Hammersley?”</p>

<p>“Ja.”</p>

<p>She peered out and saw the burly man straighten,
his heels together, and touch his fingers to the rim of
his cap. Cyril bowed and asked a question and the
other replied in a sentence that contained the word
“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hochheit</i>,” which was the only word she understood.
She crept a little closer so that she could hear more
distinctly, hoping that her slight knowledge of German
might aid her. She watched Cyril to see if he passed
anything to the German officer. Instead of this the
German took a letter from an inside pocket and handed
it to Cyril, and she heard the words “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hochheit</i>” again
and “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Excellenz</i>”—a message it seemed from some
prince, or from some general or high official of the
German Government. Cyril appeared to offer apologies
and broke the seal of the envelope, bringing from
the pocket of his overcoat an electric torch, by the aid
of which he read the letter. Doris could see his face
quite plainly in the reflected light from the page, and
marked the deep lines at his brows and the stern look
at his mouth and chin. He went over the document
twice very carefully, and then as he turned to his companion
she heard his voice saying quite distinctly in
German:</p>

<p>“You know the purport of this paper?”</p>

<p>“No, Herr Hammersley,” said the officer. “My orders
are merely to deliver this letter which was to receive
your acceptance.”</p>

<p>Cyril paused for a long moment, tapping the document
lightly with his finger and then taking a pencil
from his pocket bent over and upon the nearest rock
wrote something. Then he slipped the letter into its
envelope and handed it to the other, who put it into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
his pocket, saluted again and with a hurried farewell
turned down the path and was gone.</p>

<p>That was all. The interview had not lasted more
than five minutes, but Doris knew by the look she had
seen on Cyril’s face that danger threatened. The letter
had contained a command, a command from a
German officer of high rank to Cyril Hammersley—a
spy receiving his orders from the government he served.
If he had gone back to the Lodge at this moment she
would have let him go past her without a word, for
the bitterness came back into her heart and engulfed
all purpose. She sat in her place of concealment,
peering out at him, fascinated. He moved nearer and
then stood, his feet braced on the rocks, gazing down
the path by which his midnight visitor had disappeared.
How long he stood there motionless she could not
know, but as the moments passed and he did not move,
she rose from her cranny, her trembling nerves seeking
an outlet in motion or speech. Why didn’t he
move?</p>

<p>At last her overtaxed nerves could no longer endure
and she came out of the shadow and spoke his name.
Still he made no motion, and she realized that her lips
had made no sound. But her foot touched a small
stone, which fell among the rocks, and she saw him
wheel around and face her quickly, something glittering
in his hand, while his voice rang sharply.</p>

<p>“Stand where you are!”</p>

<p>He took a few threatening steps toward her, his
look studying her small bulk.</p>

<p>“It’s I, Cyril,” she said faintly, “Doris.”</p>

<p>“You!” He glanced to right and left, putting the
thing in his pocket and faced her, incredulous. “What
are you doing here, Doris?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“I came to—to see you again——”</p>

<p>His eyes were still searching the darkness around
them.</p>

<p>“Who told you to come here?”</p>

<p>“No one,” she lied. “I followed you.”</p>

<p>“Who saw you come? You heard?”</p>

<p>“Yes——” slowly. “O Cyril—I can’t let you go
from me like this——”</p>

<p>She put her face to her hands and felt his arms
enfold her. She trembled, but in this weakness a new
kind of strength came to her. “I want you to come
with me away—away from all this—for me—for England.
It’s my last appeal—you must not refuse it. I—I
want you so, Cyril, as it used to be.”</p>

<p>She felt his lips gently touch her brow and heard his
whisper,</p>

<p>“God bless you!”</p>

<p>She clung to him desperately, to his caress, the one
sure symbol of his purity——</p>

<p>“I love you, Cyril,” she murmured, “I can’t help
it. I’ve tried not to. But you couldn’t kiss me like
this, reverently, if you did not love me well enough to
forget everything else. Say you do, dear.”</p>

<p>“I love you,” he whispered again. “But you must
not stay here. You must——”</p>

<p>“Doesn’t it mean something to you that I came,”
she went on breathlessly, “that I could forget—what
happened—that the love that was in my heart for you
was greater than my hatred of what you are? I came
so that you could know it by the difficulty, the danger
that I ran. I don’t care what others may think of
me. The only thing that matters is to have you again.
You don’t know what it cost me to come. I am not the
kind to be held so lightly, Cyril. I have forgotten my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
pride, even my sense of what is fitting for a girl to do,
in the hope that you will listen to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he murmured, “but not now, Doris. You
must go back.”</p>

<p>“Not yet——” she protested.</p>

<p>“I—I have much to do——” he said.</p>

<p>“That messenger—O Cyril—you mustn’t. Come
back with me—tonight—now——”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” he muttered. “It—it is important for
me to stay here——”</p>

<p>She loosened his arms and stood away from him,
peering down into the cove where clouds of black
smoke were belching from the funnels of the black vessel.
The water of the cove was churning in its wake
and its prow was turning toward the harbor mouth.</p>

<p>Suddenly she saw Cyril start and peer around him
in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Who sent you here?” she heard his voice in a
strangled whisper at her ear.</p>

<p>“No one,” she denied again, “I followed you.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t possible, Doris,” he said quickly. “I
have reasons for knowing. You were here before I
came. Rizzio told you—— He knew what was to
happen—he was the only one who could have known.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Her curiosity sent all subterfuge flying.
She could see his pale face in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“Because it was Rizzio who sent this messenger to
meet me.”</p>

<p>“Rizzio!” The mystery was deepening. “I can’t
understand.”</p>

<p>He hesitated a long moment before replying, as
though weighing something in his mind.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you this much,” he said at last. “You’ve
a right to know. Rizzio told you that he was an agent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the English Government. It’s my word against his.
You can believe me or not if you like. Rizzio is a spy
of Germany!”</p>

<p>“Impossible! John Rizzio——” she whispered
aghast.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“The pot callin’ the kettle black—what? It’s the
truth.”</p>

<p>“But Rizzio! What object would he have in betraying
England? A man of his position!”</p>

<p>“That’s the kind of men England’s enemies want,”
put in Cyril dryly.</p>

<p>“But he has no need of money. Not money. Impossible!”</p>

<p>“No, not money. There are other things that John
Rizzio values more than money.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>He caught her by the arm impressively to make his
meaning clear. “You don’t know the passion of collectors.
They would sell their souls for the things
they want. The things that seem impossible are the
things they want the most.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“After the war Rizzio is to be permitted to ‘buy’
Rubens’s ‘Descent from the Cross’ from the German
Government.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she gasped in horror. A new idea of the
terrible possibilities of duplicity was borne to her. But
she couldn’t believe.</p>

<p>“How do you know this?” she asked.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the things I stopped in London to find
out.”</p>

<p>“Then you——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am a German spy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you,” she cried proudly. There
was a note of joy in her voice, a momentary note which
seemed to trail off into one of terror. “Cyril!” she
whispered. “Rizzio! He wrote me to come here.”</p>

<p>“I knew it.”</p>

<p>“But he said he——” she hesitated. “Why did he
want me to come? There must have been some other
reasons besides wanting me to see—he’s here, Cyril—somewhere——”</p>

<p>Hammersley started and turned, his hand in his
pocket, and Doris followed his look. Three men had
risen from among the rocks toward the Tower.</p>

<p>“Don’t move, Hammersley,” said Rizzio’s voice.
“You’re in danger, Doris.”</p>

<p>But the girl was clinging to Cyril’s arm. “No, no,”
she was crying. Several shots rang out as Cyril threw
her aside, dashing forward. One of the men seemed
to stumble among the rocks and fall heavily. The
other came in toward Cyril, his arm raised, but another
shot from behind the rocks made him pause, twist
half around, his hand to his shoulder as Cyril caught
him a blow which sent him reeling to the edge of the
cliff, over which he hung for a moment, peering downwards
in horror, and then disappeared from view.</p>

<p>“Well done, Stryker,” she heard Cyril cry. “The
other—this way. Don’t let him get off.”</p>

<p>And Stryker disappeared after Rizzio.</p>

<p class="cap">In a daze Doris saw Cyril bend over the prostrate
figure and then come toward her.</p>

<p>“Dead?” she whispered in horror.</p>

<p>But he didn’t seem to hear her. He caught her by
the arm and forcibly led her inland.</p>

<p>“Dead!” she whispered again. “It might have been
you.”</p>

<p>“Or you,” she heard him say sharply.</p>

<p>“Me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But it’s my fault. I should have guessed.”</p>

<p>“John Rizzio would kill <em>me</em>. Oh, it’s unbelievable!”</p>

<p>“You know too much.” He gave a short laugh.
“Far too much for your own good—or mine.” He
caught her suddenly by both arms and made her look
straight into his eyes. “Doris, you’ve seen nothing,
you’ve heard nothing tonight. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>His grasp on her arms hurt her but she bore it without
a murmur.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said.</p>

<p>“You swear it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” faintly, “I do.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go away from Ben-a-Chielt tonight. I
can’t tell you why. You’ve got to go straight to Kilmorack
House now. You rode over. Take the short
cut by Horsham Hill. It’s not so well known. I
would go with you but I haven’t a moment to spare.
Don’t trust anyone—not even the maids at the house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Go back to London tomorrow with Jack Sandys and
don’t let him leave you until you’re safe at Ashwater
Park. Where’s your horse?”</p>

<p>She told him and followed blindly.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Cyril?” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>He found the horse and untied the bridle.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Cyril. I’ve earned the right to know.”</p>

<p>“Something has happened,” he said quietly, “which
has put all my plans in danger——”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. The thing I’ve been trying to do may fail.
It hangs or falls by this issue.”</p>

<p>“But what—what?”</p>

<p>“You can’t know that,” he said quickly. “Don’t
ask me anything more. I can’t answer. But trust in
me if you can. Trust in me, Doris, and if you love
me—<em>silence</em>!”</p>

<p>He gave her a lift into the saddle and kissed her
hand. Then he looked around him and gave a parting
injunction.</p>

<p>“Now cut sharp off to the right in the darkness until
you strike the old sheep trail. You can see it quite
plainly in the heather. Follow it to the head of the
ridge, then take the road to Horsham Hill. Good-by
and God bless you.”</p>

<p>A sob rose in her throat and she could only wave a
hand in reply. And so she left him standing there
alone gazing after her with bared head in the darkness.
The strain on her nerves had told on her and she
sat her side-saddle listlessly holding on by the pommel,
and peering into the darkness before her, with eyes
that saw nothing but pictures of death. She could
not forget the wounded man grasping at space as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
tottered on the rim of the rocks. Cyril had killed a
man. War! She had thought war a more glorious
thing. This seemed very like murder. She blessed
God for Stryker who had come so opportunely. Rizzio
had tried to kill Cyril. In horror she had seen him
raise his pistol and aim, but at her cry he had missed
his shot and with the disabling of his confederates he
had fled.</p>

<p>Rizzio was a German spy. Then since they were
enemies of course Cyril was loyal—playing a part to
deceive the enemy—learning its secrets that England
might profit by them. The message! What was the
message that the German naval officer had brought
which had so disturbed Cyril? What was this mysterious
duty of Cyril’s which meant so much to his
cause, the success or failure of which hung by a thread?
She tried to think what Cyril could do in England and
after a time the thing began to come to her. Cyril
was acting for England. He had succeeded, in the
guise of a German secret agent, in finding the traitor
in the War Office, and it was Cyril who had caused
the arrest of Captain Byfield. Rizzio, too, was a German
spy who for some reason or other had been sent—O
God—that was it. The Germans suspected Cyril
and had used John Rizzio to put him to the test—had
set a thief to catch a thief. Cyril had found that
the message was a dangerous one—and had refused to
give it up to Rizzio. That seemed to explain everything—Cyril’s
willingness to have her burn the papers,
Rizzio’s anxiety to save them, that he might send
them to his employers. The second packet of papers?
A false message, prepared for a purpose which Cyril
was to fulfill. The German naval officer! His message—what
was it? Imagination refused to aid her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
She could not understand. He brought a command—a
test of Cyril’s loyalty to Germany perhaps? Was
that it? And if so, what? A test which meant victory
or defeat—that was what Cyril’s last words had meant.
Victory or defeat—life or death. It was a desperate
game that he was playing. And what was he going to
do tonight that made it necessary for him to leave her
to ride to Kilmorack House alone?</p>

<p>Bewildered and weary with excitement and much
thinking, she gave it up, and as in a daze set her mind
to the task of finding the way to Horsham Hill. She
rode on inland searching for the old sheep trail as
Cyril had described it to her, but as the minutes went
by and she did not find it she began to think that she
must have passed it in the darkness. She had ridden
at a walk for hours it seemed, keeping as she thought
in a direction which would surely lead her to a road
toward the Hill, but she realized now that she was lost
on the moor and that it might be morning before she
would find her way to Betty Heathcote’s. She stopped
her horse and peered in every direction. Nothing but
the undulations of the moor, hill and dale, a dead tree
outlined against the sky, masses of rock uncouth in
form, bushes which whispered in the wind, the babble
of a tarn somewhere behind her, though she had not
remembered passing it. There were no lights in any
direction, none even from the heavens, for the stars
had gone out. After a long while she wondered
vaguely what time it was. She had no watch, but it
seemed that a paleness like that which precedes the
dawn had spread along the sky—though it hardly
seemed possible it could be so late as that. Three—four
o’clock she thought it might be—perhaps later.
The one thing that now seemed to persist in her mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
was the hope that Wilson had obeyed orders and kept
Lady Heathcote in ignorance of her absence.</p>

<p>She was startled by her horse which, without moving,
had stretched his neck and whinnied loudly. He,
too, had realized the aimlessness of their wanderings
and wanted the warm stalls at the Kilmorack stables.
Doris tried to think what was best to do. All sense
of direction was gone and she was beyond even the
sound of the sea. At last she decided to try a slight
eminence and see if she could make out the bulk of
Ben-a-Chielt, but a mist had fallen, and when she
reached the height she was no wiser than before. Fortunately,
it was not cold, and if she did not fall from
the saddle in utter weariness, daylight would show her
a way. She got down from her horse and, fastening
him to a bush, walked to and fro to keep awake, waiting
for the day, for at sunrise she could make her way
toward the east until she reached the coast, after which
by following the cliffs to the right she would reach
the Lodge, and from there the way to Kilmorack
House.</p>

<p>She had grown accustomed to the silences and now
and then paused in her pacing to stop and listen.
She thought she heard a sound different from the
others—behind her it seemed, a subdued murmur,
which, as she listened, grew in intensity until she
clearly made it out to be the quick reverberations of a
motor, running with its cut-out open. It was coming
fast, and in a moment a long fan of light shot across
the sky from below the brow of a distant hill and then
fell suddenly to earth, where it picked out the shapes
of trees and bushes along what appeared to be its
road. The motor was not traveling toward her, but
at an angle which would make it pass near her, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
quickly as she mounted and rode toward it she was
unable even to come within earshot before the machine
had passed and was lost to sight in the distance. It
had not gone by so rapidly that Doris had not been
able to make out on a rise of ground against the sky
the profile of a roadster and the shapes of two men.
Cyril and Stryker! There could be no doubt of it,
for the body of Cyril’s car was familiar to her and
the chances of any other machine being abroad in this
locality at this hour were remote indeed. Where were
they going? In which direction? Toward Saltham
Rocks or northward? She did not know, but decided
to take the chance and follow. She reached the road
without difficulty—a trail it appeared to be with well-defined
wheel tracks and the marks of hoofs. She
pressed her horse onward in the wake of the speeding
machine, not to overtake it, but to reach a destination
of some sort which would be better than the utter
loneliness of the desolate moor, the silence and inaction
of which made her a prey to unhappy thoughts.
Her horse was willing, and as the going was good
broke into a brisk trot which for a while kept the glow
of the swinging searchlight of the machine in sight.
But presently that, too, disappeared and all was as
before. And glancing above she understood. To her
right a pale streak of light was showing along the
horizon, and above her between patches of dark clouds
she caught a faint reflection of violet light. It was
the beginning of the dawn.</p>

<p>Dawn on her right—that meant the east. She was
riding north, then. North—and to what destination?
She had ridden this road with Cyril, but never to its
end, which as she knew was among the unhospitable
crags of Rudha Mor, a wild spot unfrequented by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
except Cyril’s gamekeepers. What was Cyril’s errand
in the night to such a place when everything that had
happened would seem to indicate the necessity for his
immediate return to London? The same kind of curiosity
that had made her open the package of cigarette
papers against Cyril’s wishes, stimulated her to follow
this quest to its end. She forgot that she had had
no sleep all night, and little the night before. Of
physical weariness now she seemed to have none, and
in the growing light she urged her tired horse forward
into a hard gallop which covered the miles swiftly.
She came to the cliffs and saw the sea, passed inland
again. The going was rougher here, less turf and
more rocks and whins, while to her left the hills were
split by crags which protruded in fantastic shapes,
like heads of prisoned monsters of the underworld
which had forced their way up through the crust of
the earth to the light of day. It was curious. The
trail was well worn here as it had been before, and
there were signs of much hauling. What was going on
at Rudha Mor? The place could not be far distant,
for she saw that the road wound up the rocks and fell
away rapidly into a deep gorge, the further side of
which she could see, dimly colored with the opalescent
tint of the East. This she thought must be nearly the
end of her ride. She did not know what was in store
for her and was doubtful as to her wisdom, but she was
eaten with curiosity, and dismounted, led her horse
slowly to the lip of the gorge and peered over. What
she saw made her gasp. She drew quickly back, tethered
her horse to a bush and came forward again.
Near by, under a shed built on the brink of the cliff,
was Cyril’s roadster, but of Cyril and Stryker she
saw no sign. Beneath her feet the cliffs fell away rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
by easy steps, down which she marked a well-worn
footpath. The bottom of the gorge was of rock and
sand shelving gradually toward the sea and fairly in
its middle, built strongly of rough lumber, she saw a
shed with wide doors which even now were open—a
large hangar from which as she looked several figures
wheeled forth a huge aëroplane—to a platform of
planks which extended for a long way toward the sea.
From a distance it was difficult to judge its measurements,
but by comparison with the heights of the men
Doris knew that she had never seen a machine so large.
As the east grew lighter she could see Cyril plainly.
He came out of the hangar dressed in leather, gave
some orders which made the other figures hurry and a
series of deafening explosions from the engine as they
“tuned it up,” gave Doris a sense of immediate departure.
For a while she watched, fascinated, her interest
in the size of this huge toy and its possibilities making
a separate mind-picture which superseded all those
that had gone before. But as the light grew stronger
and she made out the color of the wide yellow planes,
she started up with a cry which would have been heard
by the men below her had it not been for the racket
that the engine was making. “A huge machine with
yellow wings,” she remembered Jack Sandys’ description,
“a thousand horsepower at least.” The Yellow
Dove—this was the Yellow Dove and the man of mystery,
its driver, was—Cyril.</p>

<p>Spellbound and trembling with excitement, she
watched Cyril climb up into one of the seats. Cyril
was going to fly to the Germans, she knew it now, to
obey the commands which had been brought last night
by the German officer, commands to come to Germany
and explain his failure to deliver his secret message to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Rizzio. They suspected him and yet he was going to
face them. It was desperate, foolhardy, insane. He
would never come back. Not victory, but death—that
was what it meant. She ran out to the very edge of
the rocks, shrieking his name, but the sounds were
lost in the fearful din of the motor below. The explosions
echoed and reëchoed in the gorge which seemed
to quiver with the volume of sound. Not a head from
below was turned up to look at her and she had a sense
of her own unimportance in the immensity of Cyril’s
viewpoint. She saw the yellow machine start slowly
down the incline, gathering momentum as it ran until
it left the runway and rose magnificently, its engine
roaring steadily, clearing the surf and rocks and heading
straight into the growing day.</p>

<p>O God! That she should have suspected him of
anything base and dishonorable—a man who could
face death as he was doing, as he had been doing for
months. Cyril—the Yellow Dove. There could be no
doubt of it, for she had seen with her own eyes. She
understood now many things that had been a mystery
before; why he could not speak to her; the reasons for
his occasional absences, for his air of indifference, for
his coolness in the face of adverse criticism. She
understood about John Rizzio and the reasons why
Cyril had wanted her to take such precautions in getting
safely back to Ashwater Park, precautions which
she had disregarded. But what mattered about her
when Cyril every day, every hour for months had taken
chances against death, the most ignominious death of
all!</p>

<p>Her heart was big with pride in him and she followed
the Yellow Dove with her gaze, now rising high
and diminishing rapidly in the mist, her soul in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
moist eyes and on <a href="#image03">her lips</a> which <a href="#image03">were whispering
words that she hoped could follow him into the distance</a>.
Her Cyril, still hers, and England’s—the
Honorable Cyril whom the world had come to know
as the Yellow Dove.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_130">“Her lips ... were whispering words that she

</div>

<p>She stood in the shelter of the rocks, for she knew
now in which way her duty to Cyril lay, and waited
until the aëroplane was but a speck against the sky,
when she turned with a sigh which was almost a gasp of
weariness and walked slowly toward her horse. The
ride before her was long, but by good riding she might
still reach Kilmorack House before Lady Betty’s
guests were up. Otherwise her reputation was gone.
She knew that, for she could make no explanation of
any kind. On that she was——</p>

<p>Quick footsteps behind her—her arms caught from
behind—a glimpse of a strange face and then something
white over her head—a pungent odor and—unconsciousness.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />
<small>VON STROMBERG</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">In the Taunus range north of the Schwartzwald,
lies the village of Windenberg, on the slopes of
the well-wooded hills that lead by slow stages
to higher elevations of the Grosser Feldberg. In the
valleys are vineyards, orchards, chestnut and almond-groves
and in times of peace, the people are contented,
well-to-do and industrious. The schloss of the
Counts von Winden stands upon an eminence and looks
down upon a rolling country of velvety woods extending
for miles along the slope of the range. In this
region of firs and beech trees one might walk for miles
off the roads without coming upon a sign of human
habitation, or indeed without passing the boundaries
of the von Winden estate.</p>

<p>But three miles from Winden Schloss well hidden
among the hills was a spot of cleared land containing
perhaps two hundred acres which had been once used
by the von Winden family as a farm, but had been
taken since the beginning of the war by the State for
purposes of its own. A good road led to Windenberg
five miles away through the forest, but much secrecy
attached to Blaufelden, as the place was called. Men
of the Imperial Forest Service kept guard upon all the
roads, and no one but those having official permission
were allowed to come within two miles of the place.</p>

<p>A visit would have soon explained the reasons for
this extraordinary care on the part of the men in uniform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
for not far from the house and stables, unobtrusive
buildings of brick and stone, were aviation
sheds, a well-supplied garage and storage houses,
which indicated at almost any hour of the day or night
a military activity.</p>

<p>Within the farmhouse of Blaufelden, rather late in
a night in March a tall iron-gray figure, slender, buttoned
to the neck in a close-fitting uniform coat, paced
slowly up and down. A plain wooden table stood in
the center of the room. It was lighted by a lamp with
a green shade and covered with papers arranged in
orderly piles. There were chairs, strongly but simply
made, and a sad-colored rug, and the walls were decorated
with pictures of hunting scenes, while over the
stone fireplace in which the pine logs intermittently
blazed, there was a colored lithograph of the Emperor
of Germany. It was the kind of room, and the kind
of furniture one would expect to find in any of the
rural districts of the great empire, with the one difference
that nowhere was there visible the touch of a
woman’s hand. Whatever its original purpose the
room at the present moment contained only the essentials
of the barest comfort. And the figure of the
man in uniform, erect, silent and austere, completed
the impression which the barrack-like simplicity of his
surroundings created—order, cleanliness, efficiency expressed
in the simplest terms.</p>

<p>The German officer stopped pacing the room and
touched a bell upon the table. His brows were furrowed
and his broad capable hands tapped impatiently
among the documents. His summons was answered
almost immediately by a man in the uniform of the
Jägers, the Imperial Forest Service, who stood silently
his heels together awaiting orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“There has been no word?” asked the officer in
German.</p>

<p>“None, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“You stationed your men as I directed?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz——”</p>

<p>The officer paused. And then, “Send Herr Hauptmann
von Winden the moment he arrives.”</p>

<p>The man saluted, wheeled and went out, closing the
door noiselessly behind him. The tall figure regarded
the door fixedly for a moment in deep thought, and
then tapped the back of his left hand with the fingers
of his right, a habit he had when things were not going
to his liking. General Graf von Stromberg, Privy
Councilor to the German Emperor and head of the
military sections of the Secret Service, was not a person
accustomed to have things go wrong, and delay of
any kind annoyed him exceedingly.</p>

<p>But the door of the room opened and a young officer
in uniform appeared and stood awaiting the will
of his superior. He was blond, ruddy and well set up
and bore all the marks of the army training—a member
beyond doubt of the military caste with something
in the clearly cut, if somewhat arrogant, features of
his face which suggested good blood and lineage.</p>

<p>“Ah, Herr Hauptmann!” said the General, frowning.
“You have heard?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz. He should be here by midnight.”</p>

<p>“What was the cause of the delay?”</p>

<p>“He was forced to come down at Ostend, yesterday.
It has taken him all day to make repairs. He is on
the way now.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg grunted and sank into his chair at
the table, motioning the younger officer into one beside
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“Come, sit down. Let’s forget that we are parts of
the intricate machinery of State. Here is a cigar.
Smoke. It will do you good.”</p>

<p>Von Winden, flattered by this mark of condescension,
obeyed.</p>

<p>“You are glad?” von Stromberg asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz. I am glad. It is not the kind of
thing one wants to be worried about—one’s own flesh
and blood. But I knew there must have been a mistake.”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg puffed his smoke toward
the ceiling and stretched his long legs upon the
floor.</p>

<p>“It is very curious. I am not sure that I understand.
Herr Rizzio is a careful man and he has much
at stake. Why should your cousin Hammersley have
refused to take cognizance of his credentials?”</p>

<p>“He had doubtless good reasons of his own. But
since he will soon be here he will answer your questions
himself. The fact that he comes at all, Excellenz,
should be proof of his loyalty.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the General thoughtfully. “That
should be true. One doesn’t thrust one’s head into the
lion’s mouth for the mere pleasure of examining his
teeth. Who sent this message?”</p>

<p>“General von Betzdorf.”</p>

<p>“There were no other wireless communications?”</p>

<p>“None, Excellenz. But Stammer should reach Wilhelmshaven
tonight.”</p>

<p>The General smoked silently for a moment, and
then:</p>

<p>“Herr Hammersley’s mother was a Prussian?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz, a sister of my mother——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember now. Von Eppingen——” the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
General muttered, his brows wrinkled. And then,
“You saw much of your cousin?”</p>

<p>“For a while he went with me to the gymnasium,
then to the University of Heidelberg. He has come
over each year and shot with me here at Windenberg.”</p>

<p>“You are fond of him?”</p>

<p>Von Winden shrugged.</p>

<p>“He is my relative. We have always got along. I
should not have cared to find that he was a traitor.”</p>

<p>The General smoked silently, his gaze on the fire.</p>

<p>“But his father was an Englishman, Graf von Winden.
We can’t forget that. Tell me. You have
known him always. What was his attitude at the University?
Did he show a real affection for German life
and customs? In short was he ever able to forget that
half of him was English?”</p>

<p>Udo von Winden pulled at his small blond mustache
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“I can only say that he was quieter than most of
us. But he was popular. He was a member of the
Saxe-Borussia and represented the Corps on the Mensurboden
against Suevia and Guestphalia. A Prussian
for all that any of us knew— Prussian of Prussians.”</p>

<p>“His father died when he was quite young, I believe?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz. But his father, too, had lived
much in Germany. He was a diplomat and scholar
and enjoyed the friendship of the Iron Chancellor.
That was before the ‘Hassgesang,’ Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“Or before the ‘Tag,’” growled the General. “Your
loyalty to your cousin is natural, but loyalty to the
Vaterland——”</p>

<p>Udo von Winden rose quickly.</p>

<p>“You would not suggest, Excellenz——?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Quatsch!</i> Sit down, Captain. I suggest nothing.
There are merely some phases of the question which
puzzle me. Perhaps when he arrives he can explain
them.”</p>

<p>“He will explain. I will stake my honor on it.”</p>

<p>“I trust so. This is hardly a time when my department
can afford to make mistakes in the character of
those in its employ.”</p>

<p>“But, Excellenz, you surely have no cause to doubt
the exactness of the information he has furnished
you!”</p>

<p>“It depends upon what you mean by exactness. Our
information, as you know, comes from a number of
sources. Some of it has proven valuable—some useless.
Herr Hammersley’s has been neither the one nor
the other.”</p>

<p>“But the British fleet at Cuxhaven——”</p>

<p>“Yes, he gave us that, but they came two days earlier
than we expected. It cost us the <i>Blücher</i>.”</p>

<p>“But you knew that the orders were changed—and
he sent a wireless——”</p>

<p>“The morning the <i>Blücher</i> was sunk,” said von
Stromberg dryly.</p>

<p>“But, Excellenz, he gave us a clear sea for the raid
on Falmouth!”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg rose and laid his hand on
von Winden’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“You are younger than I, Graf von Winden. The
Secret Service makes a maxim to believe everyone
guilty until he proves his innocence.”</p>

<p>“But Herr Hammersley?”</p>

<p>“We have reason to believe that the British Government
permitted the raid on Falmouth, as a means of
increasing the enlistments.” He slowly paced the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and then said reassuringly, “Oh, I merely question—I
merely question——”</p>

<p>His words trailed off and Udo von Winden stood
silently until he spoke again. “Oh, very well. We
shall see—we shall see.”</p>

<p>A knock at the door and an orderly entered.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Dispatches, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>Udo von Winden watched his superior officer as he
dismissed the man and broke the seal of a large envelope
and read, the lamplight playing on his long bony
features, giving his sharp nose a peculiarly vulture-like
avidity. The importance of the communication was
obvious, for the small eyes under the heavy thatch of
brows flamed in sudden interest. The General read the
paper through quickly and then slipped it between the
buttons of his coat.</p>

<p>“That will be all, Herr Hauptmann——” he said,
with a return of his military abruptness. “You will
go at once to the hangar and await the arrival of Herr
Hammersley.” And as the officer moved toward the
door: “Also, you will first tell Herr Hauptmann
Wentz that I wish to see him at once.”</p>

<p>Von Winden clapped his heels together, saluted and
went out while the General paced the floor of the room
again tapping the back of his left hand with his right.
“It is curious,” he muttered to himself. “A coincidence
perhaps, but strange. And yet—possible.”</p>

<p>While he was reading the document again Captain
Wentz entered. He was short, thickly set and dark
with a blue chin and heavy eyebrows, the type of a
man who rises in the service from sheer ability. He
waited at the door, immovable, in the presence of the
great man until ordered to approach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“An important message has come from the Wilhelmstrasse,
which indicates a mission of peculiar importance.”
The General paused a moment, his keen
eyes searching Captain Wentz with a terrible tensity,
but the face of the younger man remained expressionless.
He was merely a piece of machinery—excellent
machinery.</p>

<p>“You may have thought it curious, Herr Hauptmann
Wentz, that I should have come from the Wilhelmstrasse
to Blaufelden. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“It is not my duty to think, Excellenz, unless ordered
to do so,” said the other briefly.</p>

<p>The General smiled. The answer pleased him.</p>

<p>“I wished to see Herr Hammersley, as you know.
That is important, and the Yellow Dove cannot go to
Berlin.” He stopped and then went on quickly: “Herr
Hauptmann, you have been attached to the Secret Service
Department three years?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“You have performed several important duties and
have won promotion. I am now about to commit to
your care, a——”</p>

<p>At a gesture of von Stromberg’s thumb the officer
went on tiptoe to the door and opened it quickly.</p>

<p>“No one, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“Good. Now sit. First, you speak French without
accent.”</p>

<p>“That was a part of my qualification for this service.”</p>

<p>“Yes. It is in my mind to give you an important
mission—one which will require great skill and fortitude.”</p>

<p>Wentz listened attentively, but he made no comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is unnecessary of course to warn you to hold
what I tell you in the strictest confidence.”</p>

<p>“I do not talk, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“This is a matter of grave importance to the Empire,
a matter which concerns one of the enemies of
the Vaterland. The safe delivery of certain dispatches
which I am to receive may mean a readjustment of the
European situation—perhaps the end of the war with
Germany victorious and England humiliated.”</p>

<p>The eyes of Captain Wentz grew a little rounder
and sparkled ever so slightly, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“I am telling you this that you may know the importance
of the duty I am giving you. It is an honor
which I hope you will appreciate, an honor that may
lead to greater favors than you have hitherto received.”</p>

<p>“I hope I may deserve them, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg took the paper from his
breast and glanced over it again.</p>

<p>“You will remember,” he continued, “the affair of
the Socialist, Gottschalk?”</p>

<p>“I knew nothing of the details, Excellenz. That
matter came in the duty of Oberleutnant von Weringrade.”</p>

<p>“This much then, only, I need tell you. Herr
Gottschalk, who lived at Schöndorf near here, came
into the possession, in a manner which need not be described,
of certain important papers. He kept them
for some time, not aware of their importance, and then
realizing their value and being a good German, though
opposed to the war, two weeks ago communicated with
the Government. The result of this correspondence
was a summons from Berlin and the delivery of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
papers into the hands of the Emperor. Do you follow
me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“This letter which I have just received by special
messenger informs me that His Majesty has decided
to act at once, and gives me three days in which to
make arrangements to have these papers, which will be
forwarded tomorrow, delivered to General Dalmier,
commanding at Verdun, to be handed before a certain
date, to the President of the French Republic. You
are to be the bearer of those letters. They must be
delivered personally. You will be provided with the
proper passes and facilities, including an armed escort
to the French lines. From there you must trust to
your own resources. The important matter is that
no one, not even Captain von Winden, shall suspect
your mission. Perhaps now you will realize the confidence
I am reposing.”</p>

<p>“I am honored, Excellenz. These papers will arrive
tomorrow?”</p>

<p>“Tomorrow night by automobile at eleven, by the
Schöndorf road.”</p>

<p>“And until then——?”</p>

<p>“You will have time to make your arrangements.”</p>

<p>“I shall prepare, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>Captain Wentz rose, but the General halted him.</p>

<p>“One thing more. Herr Hammersley is returning
tonight from England with dispatches. He is to be
carefully watched tonight and tomorrow, though I
shall let him believe that he moves in perfect freedom.
You will give the necessary orders. Also I would like
you to keep watch outside the door when he is brought
to this room, which may be at any moment.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zu befehl, Excellenz.</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is all. You may go.”</p>

<p>Left alone, General von Stromberg took a chair
facing the fire, and lighted another cigar. For many
years he had been engaged in deciphering interesting
problems and in preparing problems for other persons
to decipher. Therefore it may be truly said that his
was the analytical mind, the mind of the chemist, of
the mathematician, and the philosopher, with so complete
a schooling in the trade of deception that all
things and all persons in the cosmic scheme except
himself were objects of suspicion. For him the obvious
was the negligible and by converse the negligible of
prime importance. As he had said to von Winden,
every man was guilty until he was proven innocent.
He had a rare nose for scenting unsuspected odors,
and a fine hand for finding the weak links in the armor
of those he used as well as of those who sought to use
him. He had a faculty for appearing at places where
he was least expected and a prescience almost miraculous
in forestalling the moves of his adversaries. He
ruled by fear and by admiration and there was not a
man in the Empire with a skeleton in his closet, no
matter how high his station, who did not live without
a terror of von Stromberg in his heart.</p>

<p>But the habit of mind of suspecting everybody,
while it had placed him upon the safe side of every
equation, had also resulted, through the elimination
of the sentimental, in eliminating the more direct contacts
with human nature. To judge a man by his
possibilities for venality is like judging a rose by the
sharpness of its thorn. Something of the weakness of
this cynicism had been apparent to the keen intellect
of von Stromberg and he had been finding of late a
rare pleasure in trifling with his convictions, admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
into the stored cavern of his mind for experimental
purposes, an occasional ray of optimism. At the present
moment he was analyzing the result of his summons
to Herr Hammersley to come to Germany at once and
the communication from Herr Rizzio which impugned
Herr Hammersley’s loyalty to Germany. Von Stromberg
had known Herr Rizzio for years and had done
him more than one service in finding ways to cater to
his passion for collecting objects of art. It was German
social influence secretly exerted that had helped
to make easy Rizzio’s rise in favor at the court of St.
James. There had been a possibility that some day
John Rizzio might be of service to von Stromberg and
to Germany. And von Stromberg had long been laying
the plans which had made his system of espionage
the most perfect in Europe. Von Stromberg had
found Rizzio’s weakness and had traded on it, saving
his most tempting bait for his greatest service, the
betrayal of the home of his adoption. He weighed
Rizzio contentedly sure of his own power over him and
despising him for having been so easily bought. Rubens’s
“Descent from the Cross”! There were fortunately
other Rubenses in conquered territory—some
very good ones that John Rizzio might like. Von
Stromberg had made a list of them. He had learned
that it was as necessary to be provided with bribes
as with threats. Fortunately Rizzio himself had given
him material for the latter. Racially, the great Councilor
did not like Latins, and he was quite sure he
cared less for Italians now than he did before the
proclamation of neutrality. They were not to be
trusted by good Germans. If Rizzio had played false
to the country of his adoption for the sake of a paltry
picture, it was within the bounds of possibility that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
he could be false to Germany if the necessity arose for
an even smaller consideration. Yesterday morning before
leaving Berlin for Windenberg, von Stromberg
had received a dispatch from Rizzio which told of his
departure on his yacht from Scotland for Bremen.
This was curious—also interesting. Rizzio was needed
in England and was useless in Germany. Why was
he coming? Had something been learned of him at
Scotland Yard? Or had his departure to do with the
case of Herr Hammersley? Whatever the visit meant,
it was necessary, very necessary, to have Rizzio and
Hammersley together at once, so he had deemed it wise
to send orders to Bremen to have Rizzio caught on
the wireless and when he reached port sent through
at once to Windenberg.</p>

<p>Von Stromberg smiled in self-gratulation. There
would be no loose ends about this affair. Merely as a
precaution in so important a matter he had set one
agent to watch another. Byfield had been watched by
Hammersley, who in turn had been watched by Rizzio,
who had been watched by Herr Maxwell, an agent
long in von Stromberg’s service. Rizzio had been given
the power and credentials to use his discretion with
Hammersley. Why had not Hammersley relinquished
the cigarette papers to Rizzio? Hammersley should
have good reasons for his refusal. Was there reason
for Hammersley to suspect Rizzio? Herr Maxwell,
who had been set to watch Rizzio, was silent. This
was puzzling. What had happened to Herr Maxwell?</p>

<p>General von Stromberg threw his finished cigar into
the fire and got up, rubbing his hands together. Oh,
it was very interesting—very. The situation was rapidly
approaching culmination. In a short while all the
threads of this pretty tangle would be within reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
his long fingers. And all that he, von Stromberg, had
to do was to catch them by the ends and hold. What
would Herr Hammersley bring?</p>

<p>General von Stromberg straightened, listening.
The sound of voices and men outside. So. He was
here already. There had been no sound from the machine.
Of course, he had planed down. A knock on
the door and von Winden, Wentz and Hammersley
entered.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />
<small>HAMMERSLEY EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At the sight of the tall figure of von Stromberg,
Hammersley halted for the fraction of a second
and then came forward into the room.
He still wore his leather jacket and cap, but the wind
burn on his cheeks gave his eyes, which had been protected
by goggles, a singular grayness. He had had
no sleep and his face was drawn in haggard lines, but
his greeting showed no signs of uneasiness.</p>

<p>“Had I known you were awaiting me, Excellenz, I
should perhaps have made quicker repairs.”</p>

<p>“It does not matter that you are late,” said von
Stromberg quickly. “The thing of main importance
is that you are here.” The General turned and made a
motion to the door of the room. “I wish to be alone
with Herr Hammersley. Herr Hauptmann von Winden,
you are relieved from duty for the night. Herr
Hauptmann Wentz, you will remain within call.”</p>

<p>The two officers saluted and retired and the General
motioned Hammersley to approach.</p>

<p>“You have it?” he asked briefly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz. Here.”</p>

<p>He produced from an inner pocket a small package
wrapped in oiled paper and handed it to von Stromberg.</p>

<p>“Ah!” He went quickly over to the table and tearing
off the wrapper of the bundle opened the packet of
Riz-la-Croix and found the hidden message which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
scanned quickly, with muttered ejaculations of satisfaction
and surprise. Hammersley by the fireplace
was warming his hands.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ganz gut!</i>” said the General, straightening and
turning. “You had difficulties?”</p>

<p>“More than usual, Excellenz. Captain Byfield is in
prison.”</p>

<p>“Caught!”</p>

<p>Hammersley nodded.</p>

<p>“They found letters at his rooms.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schafskopf!</i> Were there no fires?”</p>

<p>Hammersley shrugged.</p>

<p>“He is to be tried by court-martial. He will be
shot.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg deliberated a moment.</p>

<p>“And were you suspected?”</p>

<p>“Yes. They followed me to Scotland, but fortunately
the Yellow Dove is still a mystery—at least it
was yesterday morning, and I got safely away.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg was scrutinizing him keenly.</p>

<p>“H—m. What makes you think that you were followed?”</p>

<p>“I left London by night train but got off at Edinburgh
where my motor met me. But the wire was
faster, and they had sent word to stop me. They
stretched a rope across the road, but I saw it and
went around. They fired at me——”</p>

<p>“When was this?”</p>

<p>“Three nights ago.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t hit you——”</p>

<p>“A mere scratch across the arm——”</p>

<p>“Let me see it.”</p>

<p>Hammersley looked into von Stromberg’s face and
laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“Really?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Rather stiffly Hammersley took off his leather jacket
and sweater and rolled up the sleeve of his flannel shirt.
Von Stromberg examined the wound with interest.</p>

<p>“So——” he said. “Put on your coat. And after
that?”</p>

<p>“I kept away from Ben-a-Chielt and put up for the
night at my cousin’s.”</p>

<p>“Who is that?”</p>

<p>“Lady Heathcote——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. It was at her house in London that the
message passed to you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg paused a moment and then spoke
abruptly.</p>

<p>“Why did you not give the papers to Rizzio?”</p>

<p>Hammersley’s gaze met the General’s squarely.</p>

<p>“They were too important. I could not take the
risk.”</p>

<p>“But his orders superseded yours.”</p>

<p>“I saw—but I could not take the risk.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because I had reason to believe that Rizzio was
acting for the English Government.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg’s burning gaze flickered and went
out. He took a few paces across the room, his right
hand tapping the back of his left. At last he came
and stood before Hammersley, his hands behind his
back.</p>

<p>“What were your reasons for believing that?”</p>

<p>“Maxwell learned it from Byfield.”</p>

<p>“Maxwell! You saw Maxwell—when?”</p>

<p>“The night I left London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>“Has anything happened to him?” quickly.</p>

<p>“I do not know.”</p>

<p>The General frowned into the fire.</p>

<p>“It is strange,” he muttered. “Very strange. You
did not realize then that I suspected you?”</p>

<p>Hammersley laughed.</p>

<p>“Not at once. I did later. That is your privilege,
Excellenz. But I refused to be caught under the circumstances.
I preferred to take the risk of failure.
After all, you see, I succeeded.”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg was not immune from the
frankness of Hammersley’s smile. He turned toward
the table and scrutinized the papers with great care.</p>

<p>“These are the very papers you got from Herr Captain
Byfield?”</p>

<p>Hammersley’s reply was startling.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, no. The original papers were
burned——”</p>

<p>“Burned!” cried the General, turning in his chair.</p>

<p>“But not before I had made this copy, which I put
in a safe place.”</p>

<p>“Explain.”</p>

<p>“I was followed, leaving Lady Heathcote’s dinner
party in an automobile, by agents of Scotland Yard.
I had the slower machine and they caught me. But
not before I had passed the original papers to my
companion——”</p>

<p>“Your companion—a woman?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz, there was nothing else to do. She
escaped while they were searching me and kept the
papers——”</p>

<p>“Who was this woman?”</p>

<p>“My fiancée.”</p>

<p>“Her name?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Doris Mather.”</p>

<p>“English?”</p>

<p>“No, American.”</p>

<p>“And what happened then?”</p>

<p>“Excellenz, she read them. She is devoted to the
English cause. I could do nothing. She learned that
I was acting for Germany and, rather than let them
fall into my hands, she burned them. It makes no
difference to you or to the Vaterland, since I have
brought the message here, except that my own utility
in England is gone.”</p>

<p>“I should be sorry to be obliged to believe you.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, Excellenz, that there is nothing left
for you to do.”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg was again busy examining
the cigarette papers. Suddenly he raised his head,
his gaze boring into Hammersley’s face.</p>

<p>“You say this is a copy of the original message?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“And where did you make it?”</p>

<p>“In the library upstairs at Lady Heathcote’s in
Park Lane.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“After my interview with Herr Rizzio. It is written
hurriedly, as you will observe.”</p>

<p>“It is written with a pen finer than those usually
employed by ladies.”</p>

<p>“I took what offered, Excellenz,” said Hammersley.</p>

<p>“What was your thought when you made the copy?”</p>

<p>“That Rizzio or his agents would attempt to get it
away from me. It seems that I was right.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that he was acting for England and
not for me?” asked von Stromberg quickly.</p>

<p>“For <em>you</em>, Excellenz?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did it not occur to you that your failure to accede
to his request might have given Herr Rizzio the idea
that you were saving this document from him in order
that you might deliver it to the War Office?”</p>

<p>“How could such an idea occur to me when I already
knew what his object was?”</p>

<p>“Oh! You are convinced that he is for the English
cause?”</p>

<p>“Naturally. I can conceive of no reason why Rizzio
should be for Germany.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg smiled. If this were skill in parry,
he rejoiced in having met his match. If it were merely
ingenuousness, he was equally at a loss. He had often
admitted to himself that there were but two kinds of
people in the world that he could not cope with—those
who never lost their tempers and those who told the
truth. He had taken advantage of Hammersley’s
physical condition to provoke him into irritation, but
the man was quite unruffled. The piercing eye, the
threatening tone and the dominant air of authority
which von Stromberg had so frequently found effective
with others had been of no avail here. Herr Hammersley
stood by the fire, erect and unperturbed, calmly
awaiting his dismissal. If he had told the truth, then
Rizzio——</p>

<p>“Herr Rizzio has advised me that you are disloyal
to Germany,” said the General at last. “You inform
me that he is loyal to England.”</p>

<p>Hammersley shrugged and laughed.</p>

<p>“If I were disloyal to Germany, surely I had proof
enough of your suspicions in your secret summons, to
remain at Ben-a-Chielt. It is unnecessary for me to
say that I should have come without that summons,
because it was dangerous for me to stay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“You would, then, have me disregard the message
from Herr Rizzio?”</p>

<p>“No. I merely ask that you wait until you hear
from Herr Maxwell.”</p>

<p>“And if Herr Maxwell be dead?” asked von Stromberg
quietly.</p>

<p>Hammersley’s face became grave.</p>

<p>“In that case, Excellenz, I must rely on your keenness
to decide the issue between us.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg slipped the packet of papers into
an inner pocket and rose with a laugh. He covered
the distance between himself and Hammersley in three
paces with extended hands.</p>

<p>“I was only trying you, Herr Hammersley. It is a
habit of mine. It amuses me. You will forgive me,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nicht wahr</i>?”</p>

<p>“Willingly, Excellenz, if you will provide me with
food and a bed. Failing those, you may have me shot
at once.”</p>

<p>“Food you shall have, and a bed is prepared in your
room upstairs. As for the shooting, perhaps we may
as well postpone that until morning.”</p>

<p>He laughed jovially, showing a very fine set of
teeth, and, touching a bell which was answered by Captain
Wentz, directed that food and coffee be prepared
at once.</p>

<p>“One word more,” he went on, when Wentz went out,
“where did you put this copy after leaving Lady
Heathcote’s in London?”</p>

<p>“I slipped it down the window sash in my automobile.
They did not even search for it. I got away
by a ruse.”</p>

<p>“No one saw it?”</p>

<p>“No one. The message is the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“H—m! You have a good memory?”</p>

<p>“Excellent.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that the War Office knew of your
movements?”</p>

<p>“Positive. I know of no one who would try to
kill me——”</p>

<p>“Rizzio?”</p>

<p>“Acting for England, yes.”</p>

<p>“And if he were acting for Germany?”</p>

<p>“Then he is a fool.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg folded his long arms and gazed at
the lamp.</p>

<p>“You do not feel that it would be possible to return
at once?”</p>

<p>“Not unless I wished to be shot as a spy.”</p>

<p>“What will you do?”</p>

<p>“Take whatever service you will give me. Failing
that I will volunteer for aviation.”</p>

<p>The General, without pursuing the subject further,
motioned Hammersley to the door.</p>

<p>“You will find food ready. After eating you had
better get to bed. I will talk with you further in the
morning.”</p>

<p>As the door closed behind his visitor von Stromberg
sank into the chair by the fire and lighted a third
cigar, upon which he pulled steadily for some moments,
rehearsing by question and reply almost every word of
Hammersley’s story. By every rule of the game as
he knew it Herr Hammersley should be a liar. And
yet his story from first to last held water. There was
not a flaw in its texture from beginning to end. If
Hammersley had not told the truth he was the most
skillful liar in Europe, a man who gave the appearance
of truthfulness to the last hair of his head. And yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it was much more easy to lie if one knew that there
was no man to oppose him. Hammersley did not know
that Rizzio was on the way. Tomorrow they would
meet. It would be interesting to watch that meeting.
For, as to this thing, the mind of the General was
clear. One of these men was false to Germany, the
other true, but which? Both had come willingly, or
was it by necessity? And Herr Maxwell! It was
strange that Maxwell should have failed in his report
at this crucial moment. And if Maxwell were dead—who
had betrayed him? General von Stromberg’s
thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door and
the entrance of the orderly.</p>

<p>“A telegram, Excellenz, by motorcycle from Windenberg.”</p>

<p>The General opened the paper. It was in code and
he translated it rapidly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi">
<span class="smcap">Von Stromberg</span>:</p>

<p>Withhold judgment until my arrival. Will be
at Bremen tomorrow early with Miss Mather, who
possesses valuable information.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Rizzio.</span></p>
</div>

<p>General von Stromberg sank deeper into his chair,
the paper in his fingers, a smile broadening upon his
features. The woman! It was almost too good to be
true. Miss Doris Mather, the American girl, Hammersley’s
fiancée, coming to Germany with Rizzio.
And Hammersley obviously did not know it. Intrigue,
mystery and now romance. Tomorrow——</p>

<p>The man still stood awaiting orders. Von Stromberg
rose with a yawn.</p>

<p>“Is my room prepared?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Which one?”</p>

<p>“The same as before—next to that of Herr Hammersley.”</p>

<p>“Well, move it into the wing. And when I go up
you will set a watch upon my door—also one outside
my windows.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zu befehl, Excellenz.</i>”</p>

<p>“In the meanwhile send Herr Hauptmann Wentz
to me here.”</p>

<p>The man went out and Captain Wentz entered immediately
closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>“What time does the northern express leave Bremen
in the morning?”</p>

<p>“At seven.”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg sat and wrote out a message.</p>

<p>“Have this message sent at once.” And then, “That
train reaches Windenberg at what hour?”</p>

<p>“Twelve.”</p>

<p>“Good. This mountain air is excellent for the
nerves. I shall sleep late tomorrow and do not wish to
be called. You will go personally to Windenberg at
eleven o’clock with a closed carriage. You will meet
Herr Rizzio, whom you will recognize by his tall, distinguished
appearance and excellent clothing. He will
be accompanied by a young lady. It is my wish that
they be brought to this house and given separate rooms
on the upper story and placed under guard until I
summon them. No one must see them enter this house.
To accomplish this purpose, Herr Hammersley must
go to the hangar. The means I leave to you. Captain
von Winden will be of service. Do you understand?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“For the present that is all. I shall go to my room.
Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night, Excellenz.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, upstairs in his room, Hammersley, after
having eaten, was preparing for bed. For a tired
man he went about it in a very leisurely way, smoking
a cigarette, and wandering about the room stretching
his long limbs and yawning between whiles. Then,
after a time, he took off his clothes and bathed. It
was perhaps an hour before he blew out his candle,
and even then he did not get immediately into bed.
He sat on the edge of the couch for a while, listening
and watching the cold moonlight outside his dormer
window, or the dim line of light that came from beneath
the door into the hall. Then, apparently satisfied
that he was to be quite free from interruption, he
straightened and stood up, waiting again. Still no
sound. He reached for the table, where he had put
his watch and the things from his pockets, and picked
up a large pocket-knife, carefully opening the large
blade. Then, with quick, noiseless footsteps, he
crossed the room to the fireplace and felt with the fingers
of one hand carefully along the edge of the chimney
breast. His fingers reached a spot where there
was an unevenness, and feeling carefully, thrust the
knife-blade its full length beneath the paper, slowly
withdrawing it. Something protruded which was
quickly taken into the palm of his left hand. With
great care he smoothed the broken wallpaper back into
its place and noiselessly closing the knife got softly
into bed.</p>

<p>He lay on his back for a while, his eyes wide open,
watching the window and the door and then, pulling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the heavy blankets up, slipped lower and lower under
the covers until he disappeared from view. In the
room all was dark, but under the blankets he read by
the light of an electric pocket torch some writing in
German upon a thin slip of paper.</p>

<small>THE UNWILLING GUEST</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">After the light of dawn went out upon the
cliffs of Rhuda Mor, Doris Mather hung for
a long while upon the brink of an abyss, below
her darkness, above her light. She strove upward,
but in the dim moments of half-consciousness
was aware of a force restraining her and a recurrence
of the odor in which the darkness had first come. She
had a sense of motion and of jolting, the feeling of
arms about her, a descent, the sound of water and the
rocking of a boat. Brief glimpses she had of sunlight,
which revealed outlines dimly, like the glow of
summer lightning upon familiar objects, making them
curiously unfamiliar. John Rizzio’s face persisted in
these visions, a fantastic Rizzio, much larger than the
man she knew, deferential and punctilious as ever, and
strangely grave. A stout man with a swarthy face
in a cap and brass buttons, just above her, darkly
outlined against white clouds which seemed to be whirling
rapidly past him. Dully she found herself wondering
where the clouds were going so rapidly and
why they didn’t come back.... Later, darkness and
peace, where there were no visions and the sky no
longer whirled ... a steady vibration which soothed
her, and she blissfully slept.</p>

<p>When she awoke the visions were gone, and as her
senses returned she started up, but her head swam
and she sank back again. As she had risen a woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
emerged from the shadows of the room and came forward.
And then slowly, as full consciousness returned,
the girl realized that she was on an ocean-going vessel
in a cabin or stateroom very beautifully appointed.
She started up in her bed and looked out of the port-hole
to see the amber crests of waves leaping rapidly
past. Then she heard the woman’s voice speaking.</p>

<p>“You are feeling better?”</p>

<p>Doris turned and looked at her, a woman of middle
age, with a kindly face, dressed in white linen.</p>

<p>“What yacht is this?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The <i>Sylph</i>, miss—Mr. Rizzio’s,” she replied.</p>

<p>Doris thought for a moment. The last thing her
waking consciousness remembered were the cliffs of
Rhuda Mor.</p>

<p>“How did I come here?” she asked again.</p>

<p>The woman shook her head. “I don’t know, miss.”</p>

<p>Her manner was kind and most respectful but her
tone was decisive. She was obeying instructions.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Rizzio aboard?” Doris asked again.</p>

<p>“Yes, miss. And he asked me to tell you that when
you felt sufficiently recovered he would be glad to
wait upon you in the saloon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand.”</p>

<p>When Doris rose and put her feet to the swaying
deck, nausea overcame her. But the woman, who was
prepared for this emergency, offered a glass filled with
cloudy liquid.</p>

<p>“Drink this,” she said. “It will make you feel better.”</p>

<p>Doris looked into the woman’s face, and recognizing
the aromatic odor, took the draught.</p>

<p>The nausea passed after a moment and she managed
to get up and make her way to the bathroom. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
she bathed her face, memory returned, full memory
of the events of the previous night, the scene upon the
cliffs, with Cyril, the destroyer, Rizzio, Stryker,
Rudha Mor, the Yellow Dove and then unconsciousness.
Chloroform! There were vestiges of it upon her clothing
still. They had drugged her. When she took off
her shirtwaist something fell to the floor. A paper.
She picked it up and looked at it. It was Rizzio’s
note to her at Kilmorack House asking her to come to
Ben-a-Chielt—so that he might make her prisoner!
She remembered now that she had thrust it into her
waist when she went out. She folded the letter carefully
and put it in her stays. After the other indignity
she had suffered, it seemed strange that they
had not searched her, too. She would keep the letter.
Perhaps later she would find use for it.</p>

<p>John Rizzio! It was difficult for her mind to associate
him with the villainy of abduction. And yet,
as her brain grew clearer, she became quite sure that
there was no other answer to the problem. Indeed,
from the replies of the stewardess she knew that John
Rizzio had chosen that she should know it was to be a
problem no longer. The <i>Sylph</i>, that was his yacht.
She had been on the boat before, two years ago, during
the races in the Solent. Abduction! He had
dared! She was not frightened yet. Fury at his
temerity blinded her to all sense of danger. A phrase
of Cyril’s came back to her, illuminating the chaos
of her thoughts. “You know too much—too much
for your own good—or mine.” Cyril’s cigarette papers!
She was the only one beside Cyril who had read
their contents! Rizzio had carried her off, had brought
her to the <i>Sylph</i>, which was out of sight of land, speeding
for—Germany! What was he going to do with her?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>Fury passed and weakness followed. She did not
know what time of day it was, but she was aware
that it had been long since she had eaten. In the
cabin she found a tray set with food and coffee which
the stewardess insisted upon serving her. She sank
into an armchair, refusing to eat, but the woman persisted
and the odor of the coffee was tempting. It
was luncheon, she found, and remembered that she had
had no appetite for dinner at Lady Heathcote’s and
that it must be quite twenty-four hours since she had
broken bread. The coffee gave her courage, and in
spite of herself she found that she was eating heartily
with a genuine relish. She was a good sailor and the
nausea, which she now knew was the effect of the drug,
had passed. The stewardess stood beside her and to
the other questions Doris put to her answered politely,
but volunteered nothing further than she had already
told. In spite of the woman’s care and attention the
girl could not get rid of the idea that the stewardess
had been sent as a guardian as well as a maid. She
was a prisoner of John Rizzio, of Germany, whither
he was bringing her as fast as the yacht could take
them.</p>

<p>Finding at last that her attempts to extract information
from her stolid servitress were fruitless, and
feeling strengthened by the food she had taken, she
got up and told the woman that she was going on deck,
asking that Mr. Rizzio be informed that she would
see him. As she emerged upon deck the crisp wintry
air sent the color slowly into her pallid cheeks. The
yacht was bowling along with the wind and sea quartering
and the foam-crests leaped alongside, sending
an occasional spurt of spray into the air, where the
wind caught it and blew it across the decks in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
feathery mist of rainbows. The sunlight glinted on
polished wood and brasswork and at the stern
caught in the cross of St. George where the flag
of England flapped in the breeze. The flag of England
sheltering John Rizzio! She scanned the horizon
anxiously. Perhaps an English cruiser or destroyer
might come to whom she might be able to tell the real
character of the owner of the vessel. But there was
no vessel in sight. A sailor passed her and touched
his cap. The deference encouraged her. It reminded
her that this was the same deck upon which she had
stood when John Rizzio was suing for her hand, an
honorable host when she had been an honored guest.
A loud crackling came to her ears from the wireless
room. He was there, already in communication with
his employers in Germany. Even now, with Cyril’s
words still ringing in her ears, she found it difficult to
believe that John Rizzio was England’s enemy; and the
price of his treachery a picture, “The Descent from
the Cross”! What a mockery that a man who would
stoop to such dishonor could make its price a picture
which typified the conquest of sublime virtue even
over death!</p>

<p>The wind was searching and the maid brought a
heavy coat with brass buttons from below and put it
on her with the word that Mr. Rizzio had sent it and
would come to her in a few moments. She sat in a
deckchair in the lee of the deckhouse, her lips firmly
compressed, trying to think what his ulterior purpose
might be, planning a defense which might make her invulnerable,
an attack which might search his intentions
and discover the true relation that was to exist between
them.</p>

<p>He came toward her from forward, muffled in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
greatcoat, and carrying a rug. He took off his cap
with an air of deference, which answered at once some
of her questions. She rose and faced him, her color
high.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?” she asked,
trying to keep her lips from trembling.</p>

<p>He smiled and pulled at his mustache.</p>

<p>“First, I hope you’ll give me a chance to explain.”</p>

<p>“What?” she cried hotly. “What can you explain?
Don’t you suppose I know what you are? A German
spy, a traitor to England, and worse than that—a
woman-baiter and a coward, Mr. Rizzio.”</p>

<p>He bent his head.</p>

<p>“I make no defense,” he said, “except necessity.”
And then gravely indicating the chair from which she
had risen. “Won’t you sit down? The voyage may
be long.”</p>

<p>But she still stood.</p>

<p>“I am a prisoner, not a guest.”</p>

<p>“Then I command you to sit,” he said with a laugh.
“Won’t you?”</p>

<p>A sound of exasperation came from her throat and
she obeyed him, her gaze on the sea, while with some
ostentation he covered her with a rug.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me in Germany?”
she repeated dully.</p>

<p>He sank into the chair beside her. “As I have often
told you, you are a woman of rare intelligence. In
reply I can only say that, unfortunately, I do not
know.”</p>

<p>“A coward who is also a—a liar,” she said bitterly.</p>

<p>“A coward is usually a liar, but a liar isn’t always a
coward. I am a liar, Doris, if you will, but a courageous
one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“My name is Mather,” she said distinctly.</p>

<p>He shrugged and turned his gaze on the sea.</p>

<p>“You hate me, of course. We are enemies. I am
sorry. I warned you that you were entangled in an
affair that was leading you into dangerous paths. I
would have saved you, if I could, but you had learned
too much.”</p>

<p>“And so you had me chloroformed. It was a pity
that you didn’t complete your work.”</p>

<p>“I merely did what was required of me. Through
a most unfortunate combination of circumstances you
came into possession of a secret known to but one
person in England; and you are the only person with
English sympathies who knows my exact political
status——”</p>

<p>“A spy!” contemptuously.</p>

<p>“What you will—a spy if you like—but a strong
friend of Germany who resents an attempt by a nation
jealous of her growing commercial supremacy to wipe
her out of existence. I have lived in England long,
and I have known many of the men who have made
her what she is, but never in all those years has England
ever given me one token of the high nobility she
preaches. I have passed for many years as an Englishman.
I am not English. I am cosmopolitan and
to a cosmopolitan, residence is but an accident.”</p>

<p>“Pray spare me the details of your treachery.”</p>

<p>He laughed easily.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you’re at my mercy. I shall try to be
lenient. You are an American, I am an Italian. To
call me a traitor to England because I happen to have
a liking for Germany would be much like my calling
you a traitor to Germany because you happen to have
a liking for England.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have never eaten the bread and salt of Germany,
or wormed my way into the hearts of its people.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you flatter me. The people of my set in
London are agreeable, but——”</p>

<p>Doris had straightened in the act of rising.</p>

<p>“I did not come on deck to discuss your ideals or
Germany’s. I hope that you will excuse——”</p>

<p>“You will not listen?”</p>

<p>“No. I care nothing for your political views. I
am your prisoner. I want to know without further
words the worst that I am to expect from you.”</p>

<p>“You have been upon the <i>Sylph</i> before. What was
proper for you then is proper for you now. You are
quite safe in my hands. I shall try to make you comfortable.
Does that answer your question?”</p>

<p>“And after——”</p>

<p>“You are to be delivered to the head of the Secret
Service Department of the German Empire.”</p>

<p>The girl paled and sank back into her chair.</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Because you are in possession of information that
he wants.”</p>

<p>“What information? It isn’t true. I know nothing.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he apologized again. “The cigarette
papers. You read them.”</p>

<p>“No—no.”</p>

<p>“You forget that you have already admitted that.
You have also read the second message which was to
take the place of the first.”</p>

<p>“You are dreaming. A second message? I know
nothing of a second message.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, if I remind you of it. You would
have burned it in the drawing-room at Kilmorack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
House if Mr. Hammersley hadn’t taken it from your
hand.”</p>

<p>She stared at him bewildered at his astounding omniscience,
his devilish ingenuity. It frightened her, his
cleverness and his pursuit of her. It seemed that she
had never had a chance to get away from him. And
yet his manner was so carefully studied, his attitude
toward her so coldly impersonal that as a man once
a lover she no longer feared him. If love of her had
ever been in his heart, a greater passion had burned
it out. She was grateful for this and prepared to
measure her woman’s wit to his, thinking of Cyril.
What would Cyril have her do?</p>

<p>“You mean that you will let them—the Germans—question
me?”</p>

<p>“If they wish to do so.”</p>

<p>“But how will it benefit them, if the papers are
already in their possession?”</p>

<p>“You will forgive me if I find it possible to doubt.”</p>

<p>She turned away from him and studied the lines of
foam that streamed across the green troughs of the
sea.</p>

<p>“I suppose that conversation between us two is superfluous.
You distrust me and I——”</p>

<p>“I think perhaps,” he said gravely, “that it would
be pleasanter for both of us not to hear your sentiments
toward me. Since the night of Lady Heathcote’s
dinner in London you ceased to be Miss Doris
Mather and became merely an official document. It is
my duty to preserve it and deliver it safely.”</p>

<p>“I hope you may succeed. Otherwise the American
Ambassador in Berlin may——”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” he went on quietly, “the American
Ambassador cannot be informed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>She laughed with a greater confidence than she felt.</p>

<p>“You surely can’t believe that my absence from
England will pass unnoticed. Do you think that my
father—that Lady Heathcote——”</p>

<p>She paused bewildered.</p>

<p>“They will merely know that you rode late at night
to Ben-a-Chielt and that your horse was found riderless
on the moor.”</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands and a sob broke
from her throat. It was true. They would think her
dead. For the first time she really was able to think
of things in their true aspect.</p>

<p>“It’s cruel,” she gasped. “How could you!”</p>

<p>He was too wise to touch her or even by his manner
to show too deep a sympathy.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he said coolly, “awfully sorry. As
you know, I would have had things different. You
may still doubt me when I say that what I have done
is the hardest task that I ever undertook in my life.
But that is true. You were the only person in England
who jeopardized my existence there. I had to
take you away. I regret the necessity of having to use
force. I shall do what I can here upon the <i>Sylph</i> to
counteract the unpleasant impression of my brutality.
I am not a bully and a woman-baiter. I am a spoke in
the wheel of destiny which you had clogged. By all
the rules of the game you should have died. Reasons
which I need not mention made your death at my hands
an impossibility. So I merely removed you to a place
of safety. No harm shall come to you, I pledge my
honor.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” she said dully, struggling up, her face
away from him. And then dauntlessly, “Small a thing
as it is, I must be content with that.” She had risen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and turned, “And now, if you don’t mind, I will go
below. I would prefer to be alone. If, as you protest,
you would do me kindness, you will not ask to see me.”</p>

<p>He bowed.</p>

<p>“I have given instructions that you shall be allowed
to do as you please. Mrs. Madden will furnish you
with all that you require both I think of linen and
toilet articles. I shall not try to see you again until
we land.”</p>

<p>She bowed her head and went down. Rizzio watched
her until she disappeared and then walked over to the
rail and peered out over the sea. It had taken some
self-command to go through this interview as he had
planned it, and in conquering himself he had succeeded
in establishing a relation between them which made his
presence at least bearable to her. The impersonal tone
which he had used through the interview was the one
most calculated to put her at her ease with him and
the perfect frankness of his confession had made her
understand at once that sentimentally at least she had
nothing to fear from him. John Rizzio was wise in
the ways of women and the particular woman now
thrown upon his mercy, even though she was the one
woman in the world he had thought the most desirable,
was to be treated with the delicate consideration due
to her unfortunate dependence upon him. A flash of
sentiment, a breath of revelation of his ultimate purposes
toward her, and the woman would be lost to
him. Her misfortunes if anything had made her more
desirable than ever, especially since he had been the
cause of them. For one mad moment, he had thought
this morning of turning the <i>Sylph</i> toward the waters
of the South Atlantic, forgetting the quarrels of the
nations in which he had become involved, and of seeking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a new world where he could begin again, trusting
to time and opportunity and his own patience and tact
to bring a sentimental victory out of what had already
been defeat. A mad moment but a tempting one. But
the time was not yet. He must be patient. With
Hammersley gone——</p>

<p>He straightened and slowly strolled forward to the
wireless room. Toward evening he was given confirmation
of the wisdom of his course, for as he was
pacing the deck aft she came up from below and joined
him. She was looking rather white, but she smiled at
him brightly and matched her steps to his.</p>

<p>“I was lonely below,” she said. “You don’t mind?”</p>

<p>He had never thought her lovelier. Her face, if
anything, had always needed just those shadows of
pain to make it perfect.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t hoped for such a kindness. You are feeling
better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks. And since we must meet I am willing
to try to be friendly.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’ll find that I’ll meet you more than
halfway,” he said politely.</p>

<p>They talked far into the evening and at her request
they dined together in the saloon. He was reserved
but not cautious, and when the evening was over remembered
hazily that she had succeeded in learning
something from him of General von Stromberg, the
head of the German Secret Service Department, of the
aviation field at Windenberg and of the frequent flights
of the Yellow Dove since the beginning of the winter.</p>

<p>The next morning passed quietly. Doris did not
appear until noon. But just before luncheon a smudge
of smoke appeared upon the horizon, which rapidly
grew larger, and in a little while she made out the lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of a war vessel steaming in a direction which would
intercept the yacht. The <i>Sylph</i> did not slow down until
a solid shot from a gun in the forecastle of the destroyer
went ricochetting across her bows, when the
engine was stopped and John Rizzio made slowly aft to
where she stood.</p>

<p>“Miss Mather,” he said briefly, “I must ask you to
go below to your cabin at once.”</p>

<p>A glance at his face showed that her protests would
have been useless and she went below to her own stateroom,
the door of which was locked upon her. Through
the heavy glass of her port-hole she saw the vessel approach
until within hailing distance when a boat
dropped from her side into which a boat’s crew and an
officer clambered and rowed alongside. The vessel bore
no flag, but the girl clearly heard the hail of the
boarding officer and realized that the destroyer was
an English vessel. Her hopes rose. Perhaps even now
the Englishman would find something irregular in the
yacht’s papers and would take charge, conveying her
back to England. She waited for a long time and
then heard the clatter of oars and saw the boat push
off from the side of the yacht, while the officer, young,
slender and windburned, stood up in the stern sheets
of his boat.</p>

<p>“All right,” she heard him say, “sorry to have troubled
you. Pleasant voyage. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Never had English sounded so good to her. But
it was with a sigh of despair that she saw the boat
reach the side of the war vessel and felt the steadily
increasing rhythm of the engines of the yacht as she
drove once more upon her way.</p>

<p>When the two vessels were at a distance from each
other the key turned in the lock of the door and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
reply to a knock, she found John Rizzio himself, standing
hat in hand in the gangway.</p>

<p>“I seem to be in a continual state of apology. But
of course you realize the necessity for my action.”</p>

<p>“I am in your power,” she said helplessly.</p>

<p>“I hope you will believe that I shall not abuse it.”</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and followed him to
luncheon, managing to preserve at table a cheerfulness
which she was far from feeling. Throughout the
morning she had been thinking hard. And the only
course that was open to her if her courage did not
fail was the one that she was following. If she was
to be able in any way to help Cyril, she must try to
learn what she could, accept the situation with good
grace and perhaps by some turn of good fortune find
a way to disarm John Rizzio and profit by an inadvertence
or mistake. But as the second day wore on she
found her task increasingly difficult. At luncheon Mr.
Rizzio was more reserved and during the afternoon
as they approached waters in which German warships
were more likely to be found he spent much time in the
wireless room, where a repetition of the crackling
noises advised her that he was again in communication
with the land of her enemies.</p>

<p>After dinner, at which Rizzio had been very quiet,
he requested politely that she go at once to her cabin,
which she did to hear the sound of the key again
turned in the lock of her door. Despair came over her
and at last she cried herself to sleep, awakening during
the night at the glare of a searchlight which pierced
her window port. She got up and looked out to see
a dark bulk looming alongside, the flashing of lanterns,
and heard the sound of voices speaking German.
At last all was quiet again, and the steady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
hammer of the vessel’s propeller told her that the
<i>Sylph</i> was again on her way.</p>

<p>She must have slept again, for the silver of dawn
was already modifying the gloom of her cabin when
there was a knock upon her door and she rose. The
stewardess fully dressed was outside.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rizzio asks me to request you to please dress
at once, as breakfast will be served in half an hour.”</p>

<p>She obeyed blindly aware that there was no motion
to the deck of her cabin and that the <i>Sylph</i> was now
riding on an even keel. She verified her guess at the
nearness of their destination by a glance through the
port-hole, which showed her that the vessel had
reached the quieter waters of a bay or river in which
she slipped smoothly onward. There were vessels at
anchor, large and small, and beyond them she made
out the lines of a shore, upon which at intervals buildings
loomed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Madden, the stewardess, would not talk and it
was not until she reached the breakfast table that
Doris learned where they were.</p>

<p>“We shall reach Bremen shortly,” said Rizzio. “I
do not know how you feel about the matter, but I
would suggest that it would save you much trouble
and anxiety to trust yourself entirely into my hands.”</p>

<p>“I know of nothing else,” she said quietly. “What
are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I shall confer with certain officials when we reach
the city, which will be in a few moments. After that
we will take the seven o’clock train for Windenberg.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />
<small>VON STROMBERG CATECHISES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">To the girl the way from Bremen to Windenberg
seemed interminable. She shared with John
Rizzio a private compartment in the train.
He was still ceremoniously polite and inclined to conversation,
but now, thoroughly realizing the danger
which faced her as well as Cyril, Doris had decided
upon a policy of silence. She would wait until she
learned what they required of her and then perhaps
some instinct or inspiration would direct her. Of one
thing she was certain, that nothing could make her
speak if she did not think it wise to do so.</p>

<p>When Rizzio commented upon the beauty of the
passing landscape she assented with a smile and then
returned to her own thoughts. Cyril, she knew, would
be at Windenberg, for it was to Windenberg that the
Yellow Dove had made its flights. She had succeeded
in eliciting that much information from her captor
the other night at dinner when he was attempting by
frankness and hospitality to minimize the brutality
of his actions. She had many reasons to believe that
he had already regretted that frankness for at every
subsequent attempt of hers to get more information
about von Stromberg, John Rizzio had turned
the subject adroitly or had remained obstinately
silent.</p>

<p>She tried to put together the scraps of information
she possessed in order to understand just what Cyril’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
position at Windenberg might be. He had answered
the summons of the secret messenger willingly and at
once. That much was in his favor. If they had suspected
him before, this immediate obedience must have
disarmed them. In the mind of General von Stromberg
there could be no possible reason why Cyril
should put himself at his mercy. General von Stromberg
could not know as she knew that Cyril had another
mission to perform. She looked up quickly to
find John Rizzio’s dark eyes gazing at her. He frightened
her at that moment, for it almost seemed from
the expression of his face that he had succeeded in
reading her thoughts—and in the light of his previous
omniscience even that psychic feat seemed within the
realm of possibility. But he merely smiled at her and
looked out of the window.</p>

<p>That mission of Cyril’s! What was it? The obtaining
of some information necessary to England?
Some military secret such as the machinery of ordnance
or the chemical mixture of explosive shells? Or
was it something more personal, more sinister and
dreadful—the death of some high official—perhaps the
Emperor himself? She shuddered and shut her eyes,
her mind painting unimaginable horrors. Not murder—even
for Cyril she could not connive at that. But
she must be prepared to do something for him, to help
him, if she could by false testimony or if necessary,
no matter what they did to her, by silence. If they
suspected Cyril, of course he would be kept in ignorance
of her arrival. Of all these things and others
she thought with ever-growing doubt and timidity.
And all the while in the back of her head was the idea
of her possible appeal to the American Ambassador
at Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>But if she had any hopes that an opportunity would
be given her to use the post, or even to be free from
surveillance, their arrival at Windenberg speedily diminished
them. For upon the platform of the small
station a German officer met them and conducted them
at once to a closed carriage which started off through
the village immediately. The officer and Mr. Rizzio
exchanged a few commonplaces which politely included
her, but as to the real meaning of her visit and their
possible intentions—nothing. So she sank back in her
seat and looked out through a small window at the
forest into which the road almost immediately passed,
reaching their destination in apparent calmness, the
high tension of her nerves resolutely schooled to obedience.</p>

<p>A farmhouse in the midst of meadows surrounded
by forests, with a broad hospitable door in which they
entered, seeing no one. The German officer who directed
them showed her the way to a room upstairs
and when she was in the room locked the door. She
was in the dark, for the shutters of the windows were
closed. Her first impulse at reaching a haven of privacy
even though a prison was to seek the line of least
resistance and give her nerves the relaxation they
needed in tears. But she fought the weakness down,
going to the windows and peering out through a crack
in the shutters. When she tried to open them, she discovered
that they were locked or nailed from the outside.
She had been a prisoner she knew, upon the
yacht, but the firmness with which the hard wood and
iron resisted her efforts gave her for the first time the
grim reality of her predicament. A prisoner in the
heart of a German forest with no way to turn for
help! Where was Cyril? Perhaps after all, her surmises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
had been incorrect. They had sent him away to
Berlin. Or perhaps he had gone back in freedom to
England. Grave fears assailed her as to Rizzio and
his intentions. Once a friend, but after that an unsuccessful
lover! What did she know of him or of
these people into whose hands he was committing her?
Germans! She was ready to believe anything of them
after Belgium—the worst! Had Rizzio’s story about
bringing her to the head of the Secret Service of Germany
been a mere invention to serve other ends? He
had told her at Kilmorack House that he would never
give her up. Was this what he had meant? A blind
terror seized her which seemed for the moment to
deaden all her faculties for analysis. The room,
though chill, seemed to stifle her, its walls and ceiling
to be closing in to crush her. She stumbled to the bed
upon which she fell and lay for a long while exhausted
and at last the blessing of tears came to her and
then, sleep.</p>

<p>How long Doris slept she did not know, but she
realized that it could not have been long, for strange
ugly figures came into her dreams and strange ugly
events followed each other with lightning swiftness.
But a knock upon the door brought her back to the
terrors of her predicament and she answered it, wondering
what was to happen. It was a tall man in the
Jäger uniform bearing a tray of food—some toast,
eggs and a cup of chocolate. He entered with a smile
and a polite greeting in German, putting the tray upon
the table and then forcing open the shutters a little so
that a narrow bar of sunlight came into the room and
lay upon the bright drugget upon the floor. By its
light she examined the man. He was tall, grizzled at
the temples and walked with a slight limp. He smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
at her again and she could not refrain from answering
the smile in kind.</p>

<p>“I hope the Fräulein will enjoy her lunch,” he said.
“The toast especially, for I have made it myself. I
trust that the Fräulein prefers dry toast.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, anything will do. I am not hungry.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said the Forester, bowing and then
continuing in a lower tone: “The Fräulein will not
forget that the toast is excellent and that I made it
myself.”</p>

<p>She examined him curiously, wondering whether he
were not perhaps a little demented. But at the door
he bowed and disappeared and she heard the key turn
in the lock. He was apparently not too demented to
forget that she was a prisoner.</p>

<p>She was not hungry but she knew that she must eat
something to keep up her strength for any ordeal that
was in store for her, so she drew a chair to the table
and sat, pouring out the chocolate in the cup and
helping herself to the eggs.</p>

<p>All the while she thought of the strange behavior of
her servitor. Why did he lay such stress upon the excellence
of the dry toast? And why because it was
dry? She raised a piece of it with her fingers and
examined it, lifted the second piece, when a gasp of
surprise escaped her. Above the third piece of toast,
folded neatly, was a thin strip of paper. She glanced
toward the door and window and then getting up from
the table and going to a spot where observation of
her actions was impossible, opened the slip of paper.
It was in Cyril’s hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Don’t be frightened [she read]. You are to be
questioned. Follow these instructions. I made copy
of message in Heathcote library night of dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
while waiting for you to get wraps. I hid it in right
sash of motor. Copy and original of message the
same. You and I are enemies. Therefore ignore
me. Rizzio acted for Scotland Yard. As to the rest
tell truth exactly and no harm can come to me. I
will find means later to communicate. Burn this
immediately.</p></div>

<p>Her heart beating high, she read the paper through
twice to familiarize herself with the instructions which
she perfectly understood. Then she found a matchbox
on the candlestick, put the paper in the hearth
and burned it. After that she sat at the table and ate.
It was there that Captain von Winden found her some
moments later when he came to request her presence
in the room on the ground floor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>During the time that Doris slept, in the living-room
downstairs General von Stromberg sat with John Rizzio.
A peaceful winter landscape looked in at the windows,
the sun slanted in a yellow rhomboid upon the
floor, a cheerful fire was burning upon the hearth and
General von Stromberg, his left hand tapping gently
upon the back of his right, was gravely listening to
John Rizzio’s story. All of the pieces of the little
game were upon the board. He was now about to move
them skillfully from one square to another until only
one piece remained, and that one piece, the victor in
all such games, was—himself.</p>

<p>“And what was his manner,” went on von Stromberg,
“when you showed your credentials?”</p>

<p>“He was surprised—very much surprised—and I
think alarmed.”</p>

<p>“And what arguments did you use to make him give
the packet up?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“I threatened him with serious consequences.”</p>

<p>“Which meant <em>me</em>,” said von Stromberg grimly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz. But he refused without other
grounds than his own judgment.”</p>

<p>“And then——”</p>

<p>“Excellenz, Fräulein Mather came in. She heard
something from behind the curtain—but she gave no
sign.”</p>

<p>“Oh! She is clever?”</p>

<p>“Exceptionally so. I have brought her here of my
own volition and she will speak if properly approached,
but I hope Excellenz will be pleased to make
the interview as easy for her as possible. If any harm
should come to her——”</p>

<p>“It is not the practice of my department to do
hurt to women,” said the General quickly. Then he
laughed. “I suspect, Herr Rizzio, that you have a
tenderness in that quarter.”</p>

<p>“It is true. I hope, therefore, that you will be
patient with her.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>“And what happened then?”</p>

<p>“Hammersley and Miss Mather went out. I remained
in the smoking-room and then telephoned to
Maxwell to send his men at once. They came. I met
them outside the house before Hammersley emerged
and gave them my instructions to follow Hammersley’s
machine and get the papers.”</p>

<p>The older man started forward, his long acquisitive
nose eagerly scenting a clue.</p>

<p>“And how long was it after they left the smoking-room
for the machine?”</p>

<p>Rizzio pulled at his mustache a moment thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“I could not say exactly,” he said after a time. “A
matter of half an hour perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Did you know what Herr Hammersley was doing
in the meanwhile?”</p>

<p>“No. I could not say. I telephoned first and then
went out. The guests were all in the drawing-room.”</p>

<p>“Did you go up to the library?”</p>

<p>Rizzio showed surprise. “No, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure that Herr Hammersley was in the
drawing-room with the others when you went out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz. I am sure of it. There was no
reason for him to be anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“There was no chance of his going upstairs to the
library for ten—fifteen minutes—without your seeing
him?”</p>

<p>Rizzio straightened and pulled at his mustache.
“Excellenz, I think I understand the object of your
questions. It is not possible that Herr Hammersley
could have made a copy of the papers at Lady Heathcote’s
house.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg paused a moment, then he asked:</p>

<p>“How long after you left the door of the house before
he came out with the lady?”</p>

<p>“Scarcely more than ten minutes.”</p>

<p>The General’s fingers tapped more rapidly.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he growled, “I see.” And then, “Tell me how
the matter was arranged that Captain Byfield should
deliver those papers.”</p>

<p>“Maxwell managed it through a cipher. The War
Office had grown suspicious and all the usual channels
were closed. Byfield was frightened and refused to
deliver further messages. So Maxwell hit upon the
scheme of the cigarette papers to be delivered to Hammersley.
I could not receive them from Byfield because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of your instructions not to let my interests be
known to anyone in England but Maxwell—you
thought the time was not ripe for me to play my
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup</i>.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said von Stromberg dryly, “but the time is
ripe now and you are not there to play it.”</p>

<p>“But this affair was of such importance——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” the general broke in quickly, “go on.”</p>

<p>“It was the day of an anniversary always celebrated
for me by Lady Heathcote, whose house, as you know,
is one of the most exclusive in England and above
suspicion. I invited the guests and Maxwell communicated
with Hammersley, arranging the manner of the
exchange which was accomplished. My demand upon
Hammersley was made in accordance with your orders.
It was a test of his loyalty. He failed.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he had an opportunity to glance at
the papers, I mean between the time he received them
and the time of your demand of him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He studied them for a moment behind the
curtains of an alcove in the drawing-room. I was
watching. I saw his shadow as he bent over to the
light of the lamp.”</p>

<p>“By that you mean he had a hope that they might
be spurious?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz. When it was discovered that there
was a leak, false orders were issued to test the different
departments of the War Office.”</p>

<p>“H—m. And then, Maxwell’s men followed him, and
when he was on the point of capture he turned the
papers over to the lady, who escaped through the
hedge?”</p>

<p>“As I have said before, Excellenz, the lady is clever.
She read the papers, but her loyalty to Hammersley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
kept her silent, though at that time she suspected that
he was a German agent.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said von Stromberg, manifesting a sudden
activity with his fingers. “The lady is interested in
Herr Hammersley?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“More interested in him, perhaps, than she is in
you?”</p>

<p>Rizzio bowed in silence.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gut</i>,” said von Stromberg rising. “That perhaps
makes matters more amusing for us—perhaps a little
more amusing for Herr Hammersley.”</p>

<p>He paced the floor with long strides while Rizzio
watched him until he stopped before the fire and spoke
again.</p>

<p>“Herr Rizzio, you have told me about the events in
Scotland when, as you say, Hammersley, acting as an
Englishman, warned the lady against you as an agent
of Germany. What I would like very much to know is
why, when you were sure he was acting for England,
you did not have him killed at once.”</p>

<p>“I tried, Excellenz, but he was too well prepared for
me. My men shot at him on the road and wounded
him slightly—but on the cliffs at Ben-a-Chielt he had
a confederate who killed one of my men. The other,
as I have related, fell over the cliffs.”</p>

<p>“But you”—put in the officer harshly—“what were
<em>you</em> doing all the while?”</p>

<p>“I shot at him and missed.”</p>

<p>“That was unfortunate—from our point of view. It
is not the custom of agents of my department to miss—at
anything, Herr Rizzio. But since Hammersley
is here, the damage, if damage there is, can be repaired.
What did you do after that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>“I had reason to suspect that Hammersley was the
cause of the arrest of Captain Byfield. I had also reason
to suspect that he had informed, or would inform,
the War Office as to my connection with Germany.
Accordingly I had made arrangements to have my boat
within easy reaching distance of Ben-a-Chielt. With
the help of two other men who had been set to watch
the roads in case of surprises I kept watch on Hammersley.
Miss Mather we lost in the darkness of the
moor. This was unfortunate, as I had planned to take
her, too. But we followed Hammersley on horses to
Rudha Mor to be sure that he would obey your summons
and fortune aided us, for Doris Mather had followed
him, too, and we managed to take her without
difficulty—and brought her aboard the yacht. Hammersley’s
departure for Germany, of course, relieved
me of all responsibility on his behalf.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg paused before the fireplace, his brows
puckering.</p>

<p>“On the whole, Herr Rizzio, you have done well.
I shall not complain. But if your story is true, I should
like you to tell me two things. The first is, why
should Herr Hammersley return to Germany to face
certain death at my hands?”</p>

<p>Rizzio shrugged his fine shoulders.</p>

<p>“Excellenz, I do not know. I did not think he
would come when I sent you my request to summon
him. The knowledge he possessed was dangerous to
me and I had made every possible plan to kill him at
Rudha Mor. Nothing that could have happened surprised
me more than when I saw him fly out in obedience
to your message. It has puzzled me. I do not
know why he came unless it was to learn something in
Germany and return to England.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Von Stromberg gave a dry chuckle.</p>

<p>“The supposition does not flatter his intelligence or
mine. Aside from the difficulties of his position at
present, if he were seeking information as to the plans
of the Empire, he would have about as much chance of
getting away from here alive as you would have, Herr
Rizzio, in the same circumstances.”</p>

<p>The old man towered to his full height and brought
his huge fist down with a crash upon the table which
startled Rizzio, who fingered his mustache, his face
a shade paler.</p>

<p>“I am glad, Excellenz,” he said with a laugh, “that
I am not in Hammersley’s shoes.”</p>

<p>Disregarding Rizzio’s comment, the old man paced
the floor again, storming.</p>

<p>“The other question that I would like to ask you is,
what has become of Herr Maxwell?”</p>

<p>Rizzio started up, now in genuine concern.</p>

<p>“Have you not heard from him, Excellenz?”</p>

<p>“No,” roared the other. “Why haven’t I? You
should know.”</p>

<p>“I do not know. I saw him the day I left London
for Scotland. He was fully informed of all that had
happened. Could it be that——”</p>

<p>Rizzio paused with a deep frown.</p>

<p>“Where is he? Why has he not reported? Could
anything have happened to him? What were you
thinking?”</p>

<p>“That Hammersley perhaps—but that could hardly
be—since he always moved under cover——”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Du lieber Jesu!</i> Speak out! Will you?”</p>

<p>“I thought that Hammersley might have been the
cause of his arrest.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you think that? Why?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because it was Hammersley who told the War Office
of Byfield——”</p>

<p>“What proof have you of that?”</p>

<p>“No one knew of Byfield’s connection with us but
Hammersley, Maxwell and myself.”</p>

<p>“Those were my orders. How do I know that they
were obeyed?”</p>

<p>“One doesn’t disobey orders, Excellenz, with one’s
head in a noose.”</p>

<p>“H—m. There are many necks in nooses at Windenberg.
And one of the nooses will be tightened.”</p>

<p>He had stopped before Rizzio and was scowling at
him with eyes that shot malevolence. Rizzio knew
something of von Stromberg’s methods and was sure
that he was merely trying to intimidate him, to reduce
him to a consistency which would reveal hidden weaknesses
in texture; yet, knowing this, Rizzio felt most
uncomfortable. He twirled his mustache and looked
out of the window, but his glance came back to von
Stromberg’s eyes, which never wavered or changed in
intensity, as though under the influence of some strange
hypnotic attraction.</p>

<p>“You know, of course,” the old man’s harsh voice
snapped at him, “what Herr Hammersley accuses you
of?”</p>

<p>“I can imagine, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“He says that you have been acting for the English
Government.”</p>

<p>Rizzio started up in alarm.</p>

<p>“You do not for a moment believe——”</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited. I believe nothing—which I do
not wish to believe. But he tells a very pretty story,
Herr Rizzio.”</p>

<p>“He would,” said Rizzio easily. “I will do him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
credit of saying that he is skillful. But a lie will discover
itself in the end.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I am glad you agree with me. What I
now propose to do is to set the lie in motion. The
easiest way to provoke a liar is to put him upon the
defensive. You and Hammersley shall debate the matter.
I shall be the judge of the debate. We shall see
what we shall see.”</p>

<p>He strode to the table and was about to touch the
bell when Rizzio broke in.</p>

<p>“One moment, Excellenz. I should like to know on
what he bases his accusation.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Not weakening, Rizzio?”</p>

<p>“Hardly, Excellenz,” the other smiled. “It will not
be difficult for me to verify my statements if Hammersley
will only talk.”</p>

<p>“You need not fear. He will talk.”</p>

<p>“What I wanted to know, Excellenz, was the nature
of the information received in the yellow packet.
Would you permit——?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, Herr Rizzio, not yet. The contents of
the message will come in time. For the present there
is quite enough to occupy Herr Hammersley’s mind—and
yours.”</p>

<p>Rizzio shrugged. “As you please. I would like to
know, however, before you summon him, whether his
accusation is based on my attempt upon his life.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg chuckled. “Is not that enough to
prejudice a man—if he were honest?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if he were honest,” said Rizzio. “Did he have
any authority for his belief?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Rizzio,” said the General, fixing Rizzio
with his stare. “He told me that Maxwell had learned
it from Byfield.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Byfield!” Rizzio started forward quickly. “Hammersley
is a fool. Have I not told Excellenz that
Byfield knew nothing whatever of my connection with
the affair?”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg stretched his long arms impatiently.</p>

<p>“Herr Maxwell, unfortunately, is silent. Captain
Byfield is in a position where the only questions that
can be put to him will be those at the Gates of Heaven
by his Maker.”</p>

<p>He gave the bell on the table a resounding blow and
grinned mischievously at Rizzio.</p>

<p>“You say that Herr Hammersley is a fool. He
asserts that you are one. I shall now smoke a cigar
and decide for myself which of you is correct.”</p>

<p>And, as the soldier entered, “Tell Herr Hammersley
that I wish to see him here at once.”</p>

<p>“I can only say, Excellenz,” said Rizzio, when the
man went out, “that I am willing to abide by your
verdict.”</p>

<p>“Even though it should be unfavorable to yourself?”
growled von Stromberg.</p>

<p>“That, Excellenz, is quite impossible.”</p>

<p>“I have known stranger things to happen. The
worst aspect of your case is that Herr Hammersley is
here. There was no need for him to come. You
yourself admit that. He had only to stay in England
to devote his talents to a more congenial occupation.”
Von Stromberg puffed on his cigar and leaned across
the table. “Can you tell me why Herr Hammersley
came to Germany? Answer me correctly, Rizzio, and
I will give you every masterpiece in Belgium.”</p>

<p>Rizzio frowned into the fire.</p>

<p>“I cannot say,” he replied. “I have admitted that
he has puzzled me. I can only think of one thing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Hammersley is a type of man who under the guise of
inefficiency does all things well. He is a sportsman.
He would do such a thing for the love of adventure,
because the danger, the excitement, appealed to him—because
it was the ‘sporting thing.’”</p>

<p>“A reason, Rizzio,” muttered von Stromberg, “but
not the real reason.”</p>

<p>Rizzio started and a smile broke at the corners of
his lips.</p>

<p>“Oh! You realize, then, that there is something else—something——?”
He paused.</p>

<p>“I realize nothing,” growled the General. “Realization,
Rizzio, is the one banality of existence! Uncertainty
is the only thing worth while. When one is certain
of anything it ceases to be interesting. That is
why Herr Hammersley, whom you call a fool in one
breath and a genius in the next, excites my profound
attention. Come, I think you will agree with me that
he is worth it.”</p>

<p>“I do not like Hammersley, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Natürlich!</i> But that need not prevent your interest
in him, even though your interest is largely in his
death.”</p>

<p>The phrase was significant, delivered significantly,
and in spite of himself Rizzio felt the gaze of the General
piercing his veneer.</p>

<p>“I could feel no happiness in such a misfortune,”
he said gravely, “notwithstanding my dislike of him.”</p>

<p>A knock at the door interrupted further conversation
and, at a command from the General, Hammersley
entered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />
<small>THE INQUISITION</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">If General von Stromberg had counted upon playing
a trump card in producing Rizzio at this
interview, Herr Hammersley’s demeanor must
have disappointed him. For he entered the room with
cheerful composure, noted Rizzio, stared at him in sudden
seriousness, and then turned to von Stromberg with
the air of a man briskly intent.</p>

<p>“You wanted to see me, Excellenz?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p>He had evinced a mild surprise at Rizzio’s presence,
but no discomposure. If anything, his manner now
had a kind of sober eagerness as at the imminence of
an issue in which a necessary if painful duty must be
performed.</p>

<p>General von Stromberg from his armchair regarded
him through a cloud of tobacco smoke.</p>

<p>“Yes, Herr Hammersley,” said von Stromberg. “As
you will observe, Herr Rizzio has just arrived from
England. He followed you almost immediately upon
his yacht. It is most fortunate that he is here, for
there are several matters which we can discuss in privacy
together.”</p>

<p>“I am at your service, Excellenz,” said Hammersley.
“If there are any facts which I can add to my report
I shall be glad.”</p>

<p>His idiom was Hanoverian. Rizzio, quite cool, faced
him, upright, with folded arms.</p>

<p>“To begin with, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">meine Herren</i>, we will sit. To stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
is the attitude of discomposure. One thinks more
calmly sitting down. You have my permission. So—Now
we will proceed. I will outline in the briefest
words the situation. Herr Hammersley, an agent of
the Secret Service Department of the Imperial Government,
is intrusted with the receipt and delivery of
certain secret messages. He receives them, but is requested
by Herr Rizzio, also an agent of the Secret
Service Department of the Imperial Government, on
authority of indubitable credentials, to relinquish the
message to Herr Rizzio. It is not necessary to state
the reasons of the Imperial Secret Service Department
in desiring the transfer of this message. It is sufficient
that Herr Hammersley refused to obey the orders.
He has given explanations which, on their face,
seem adequate. Upon the side of Herr Rizzio it may
be said that, failing in his object, he came to a certain
conclusion most unflattering to the loyalty of Herr
Hammersley. We will now proceed in orderly fashion
to hear the cause of Herr Hammersley’s refusal and
the subsequent acts of Herr Rizzio which have created
so great a misunderstanding. Herr Hammersley,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">bitte</i>, you will tell us the facts as you have related
them.”</p>

<p>“I learned from Herr Maxwell that Herr Rizzio
was playing a double game. Captain Byfield had furnished
him with full proofs of it, one of which was a
letter he had seen from Herr Rizzio to a military officer
high in the councils of the War Office. This was
an additional reason, Excellenz, why Herr Maxwell
arranged with Captain Byfield that the cigarette papers
should be delivered to me.”</p>

<p>Rizzio leaned quickly forward, his face dark with
passion. “Excellenz,” he began, “that could not possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
be true. The real reason for the delivery of the
message to Herr Hammersley Excellenz well knows.
And Herr Maxwell would hardly send men to follow
Herr Hammersley at my request if he disbelieved in my
loyalty.”</p>

<p>“Quite so. He would not and did not,” said Hammersley.
“The men were not Herr Maxwell’s. They
were men of Scotland Yard. It is quite obvious by
the way they bungled matters.”</p>

<p>The General smiled delightedly. It was the sort of
joke he liked. “That is one point in your favor, Hammersley.”</p>

<p>Rizzio shrugged.</p>

<p>“Excellenz well knows,” he said, “why those men
were sent. They had instructions to get the papers
for Maxwell.”</p>

<p>“That is strange,” said Hammersley. “If Maxwell
had asked me personally for the papers, I should have
given them to him. Maxwell would have known better
than to intrust those papers to a third person. It is
not likely that I should have given them up to any
man, even if Maxwell had sent him.”</p>

<p>“It is unfortunate that Herr Maxwell is not here
to——”</p>

<p>“One moment, Herr Rizzio,” broke in the General.
Then to Hammersley, “What was the nature of the
letter which you say was sent by Herr Rizzio to a
high official of the War Office?”</p>

<p>“It was a statement in regard to the case of Carl
Hüber, who, as you know, was shot last week in the
Tower of London.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach!</i>” Von Stromberg frowned. “We are killing
our evidence too fast, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein herr</i>, a little too fast for
convenience. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bitte</i>, we will kill no more German agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in the Tower until they have had an opportunity to
testify.”</p>

<p>Hammersley smiled.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, Excellenz, I have no means of restoring
him to life,” he said. “He was an excellent
man, and leaves, I believe, a wife and six children.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg tapped his fingers slowly.</p>

<p>“We will go on, if you please, with the discussion of
the general facts. You claim that Herr Maxwell, distrusting
Rizzio, arranged that the papers should be
handed from Captain Byfield to you. I have told you
that Maxwell had orders from me to put you to this
test?”</p>

<p>“Pardon, Excellenz. I did not know that at the
time. I only know that Herr Maxwell chose to disregard
your orders to him and Rizzio, instructing me
not to deliver the papers to Rizzio under any circumstances.”</p>

<p>“When did Herr Maxwell make the discovery of
Herr Rizzio’s—er—treachery?”</p>

<p>“It was the evening of Lady Heathcote’s dinner.
Captain Byfield had learned the truth that afternoon.”</p>

<p>“One moment!” Rizzio rose, his face pale with anger.
“It is easy to manufacture evidence of this kind,
where both of the witnesses mentioned are beyond
reach. I will not even deny the truth of their charges.
They are too absurd. If I was acting for England,
will Herr Hammersley tell me why the agents of Scotland
Yard, whom he says I sent for, did not surround
the house at Ashwater Park and boldly demand the
papers from Miss Mather, in the name of the Government
and the law?”</p>

<p>“The reasons are obvious,” replied Hammersley. “I
will give Herr Rizzio the credit for that much delicacy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
If his men had found the papers at Ashwater Park,
Fräulein Mather, whom Herr Rizzio esteems most
highly and who was quite innocent, would have eventually
been imprisoned by the Government as a spy.
At his orders the house was therefore secretly searched
by night, I am happy to say, unsuccessfully. Herr
Rizzio will surely not deny the kindness of his motives
upon that occasion?”</p>

<p>“Excellenz will take that reply for what it is worth.
Scotland Yard has never permitted sentimental considerations
to interfere with the performance of its
duties.”</p>

<p>Hammersley went on stolidly: “I cannot conceive
of any agents of Germany attempting to kill me. This
my pursuers did at Saltham Rocks and again in the
person of Rizzio himself on the cliffs at Beaufort Head—even,
Excellenz”—Hammersley leaned forward, smiling
blandly—“even after he knew that I had met Captain
Stammer and conveyed my acceptance of Excellenz’s
invitation to return to Germany.”</p>

<p>“I was not sure that he would go.”</p>

<p>“If not for any other reasons, Excellenz, the pursuit
of the agents of Scotland Yard would have been sufficient.
Fortunately, however, I had intended going as
the bearer of the Byfield message. And I carried it.
You can’t deny that.”</p>

<p>“He brought a message, Excellenz,” put in Rizzio
quickly. “But what message? There were two messages.
One prepared by Captain Byfield—the other
prepared by Hammersley.”</p>

<p>“I do not deny that. When I discovered that I was
likely to have an interesting evening I made a copy
of the papers in a package of Riz-la-Croix which I
had in my——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Rizzio broke in quickly. “That copy was made not
at Lady Heathcote’s that night, but at the War Office
or elsewhere the following day. It was prepared for
the emergency of capture and, escaping that, for delivery
to General von Stromberg.”</p>

<p>“General von Stromberg has been told about those
papers. I have told him where and when I made the
copy.”</p>

<p>“And where was that?” asked Rizzio keenly.</p>

<p>“In the library at Lady Heathcote’s while you were
telephoning to Scotland Yard.”</p>

<p>Rizzio struggled for control, and then with dignity
to von Stromberg, “I was telephoning to Herr Maxwell,
Excellenz.” He turned to Hammersley with a
confident smile. “Assuming for the moment that what
you say about copying the papers is true, what did
you do with the copy?”</p>

<p>“I took it out to the motor, where I slipped it down
the window sash,” Hammersley laughed. “Surely, Rizzio,
the tall man from Scotland Yard must have told
you that when I escaped I shouted to him that he had
not searched the motor.”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg broke in suddenly.</p>

<p>“Why did you say that?”</p>

<p>Hammersley shrugged. “I had injured their motor,
and I knew that I should escape. The bravado of triumph,
Excellenz. I was rather happy, for, as a fact,
they had given me an uncomfortable evening.”</p>

<p>Rizzio leaned across the table.</p>

<p>“Excellenz, it was to draw attention from the girl,
who had the original message and who had concealed
herself in a tree.”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg took a small object from his
pocket and weighed it lightly in the fingers of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
hand. It was the package of Riz-la-Croix. As Hammersley
was about to speak, he held up the other hand
in demand for silence.</p>

<p>“We are not getting very far, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">meine Herren</i>,” he
said. “Both of you tell excellent stories of your adventures
worthy of the best traditions of the Secret
Service Department. If, as Herr Rizzio alleges, Herr
Hammersley has substituted other papers for the original
ones burned by Miss Doris Mather, Herr Hammersley
will be shot. If, as Herr Hammersley alleges,
Herr Rizzio was in communication with Scotland Yard,
the officers of which attempted the life of Herr Hammersley
while he bore dispatches for me, Herr Rizzio
will be shot. It is a very delicate matter, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">meine Herren</i>,
one which will require much thought, since the
one man who could settle the question is in an English
prison.”</p>

<p>Hammersley started a pace forward. “Oh, then he
<em>is</em> taken!”</p>

<p>Rizzio glanced quickly at Hammersley.</p>

<p>“Excellenz, the same person who caused the arrest
of Captain Byfield gave Maxwell to the police.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg’s gaze followed Rizzio’s to Hammersley.</p>

<p>“And you, Herr Hammersley. What do you suggest?”</p>

<p>“If the report is true, Excellenz, I quite agree with
Herr Rizzio,” he said easily.</p>

<p>Von Stromberg showed his teeth in a wolfish smile.</p>

<p>“And each of you contends that it was the other,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nicht wahr</i>?”</p>

<p>Hammersley merely nodded, but Rizzio was by this
time in a state which made self-control an impossibility.
“Excellenz,” he cried hotly, “is it conceivable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
that I should have come to Germany if I had been
guilty of the crime of which this man accuses me? I
have served Germany against——”</p>

<p>“You forget, Herr Rizzio,” said the General blandly,
“that Herr Hammersley has also come to Germany.”</p>

<p>“And while he is here Germany is in danger. He is
a spy of England, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>Hammersley only laughed.</p>

<p>“If I had been a spy of England, Excellenz, I surely
had many chances to serve England’s cause. Why
should I have even met Captain Stammer at Beaufort
Cove? It would have been quite easy to have informed
the artillery officer at Innerwick and blown his destroyer
out of the water while she lay at anchor?
Herr Rizzio forgets that honesty is always provided
with proof. In reply to this accusation, I would ask
Herr Rizzio how he managed to pass through the cordon
of British destroyers which guard the coast?”</p>

<p>Rizzio hesitated and von Stromberg spoke.</p>

<p>“That is a fair question. Answer.”</p>

<p>“I had English papers as well as German. I came
away before the War Office had time to act upon Herr
Hammersley’s information as to my services to Germany.”</p>

<p>Hammersley shrugged. “I make no reply.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg frowned at the opposite wall, snapping
the papers of the package in his fingers impatiently.</p>

<p>“An <em>impasse</em>! I suspected as much. We will now
resort to other means. The only possible solution of
this case, barring the unpleasant alternative of shooting
both of you gentlemen in the garden this afternoon
lies in the nature of the dispatches themselves and in
the production of a material witness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>He brought his broad palm down on the bell upon
the table and said to Captain von Winden, who answered
it:</p>

<p>“You will bring Fräulein Doris Mather down to
this room at once.” As Captain von Winden went
out, the eyes of both men were turned to Hammersley.
He started in surprise, and leaned forward
toward von Stromberg, slowly turning with a frown to
Rizzio.</p>

<p>“Doris—Miss Mather—here!” he muttered. “She
came—with—with Herr Rizzio?”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg nodded.</p>

<p>“Herr Rizzio persuaded her to come with him.”</p>

<p>“Persuaded! It is impossible.” He rose and took
a pace toward Rizzio. “What could have been his
object? I do not understand. It will be very cruel for
her to—to see me—since she knows that I am an enemy
of England, Excellenz. She it was who read the papers
and burned them. If Herr Rizzio supposes that
Fräulein Mather’s evidence will——” He paused, his
brow knitting in thought.</p>

<p>“Her evidence is important,” said von Stromberg.
“Under the circumstances you should be glad to have
such an enemy to testify against you. Sit down, Herr
Hammersley. I regret that the necessities of the case
require this witness.”</p>

<p>Hammersley sat and, frowning at the wall opposite,
folded his arms. “I am at your orders, Excellenz. I
need not remind you that she will tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“That,” said von Stromberg, with a wide wave of
the hand, “is precisely what we are here for.”</p>

<p>There was a silence, grim and amusing on von
Stromberg’s part, self-restrained on Rizzio’s. Hammersley
still sat staring at the wall, thoughtful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
apparently in no great enjoyment of the prospect.</p>

<p>When the door opened and Doris Mather entered
the three men rose. Her face was pale and lines of
care were at her eyes and lips, but there was no denying
the proud poise of her head, the firmness of her
mouth and the steady look from her eyes as her glance
passed Rizzio and Hammersley and sought the figure
of the man in uniform. She measured him with a look
that neglected nothing, her gaze finally meeting the
dark shadow under the gray thatch of brows where his
small eyes gleamed at her. The General bowed, clicked
his heels together and brought forward a chair, which
he indicated with a polite gesture.</p>

<p>“I offer apologies, Fräulein, for the unfortunate
situation in which Destiny has placed you,” he said
in excellent English. “Will you be seated?”</p>

<p>The girl sat and faced him, her gaze still fixed upon
his face. It was as though she meant to ignore the
presence of the other two men. General von Stromberg
stared at her for a moment in silence, and then,
finding that his frown was only met by a look of calm
inquiry, smiled at her instead.</p>

<p>“You know, of course, Fräulein, the situation with
which you are confronted. Herr Rizzio has brought
you to Germany to shed what light you can upon the
mystery of these cigarette papers. Herr Hammersley
says that Herr Rizzio has been acting as an agent
of the English Government while professedly in the
service of Germany. Herr Rizzio says that Herr
Hammersley is an English spy. Your position is a
difficult one, but circumstances have woven you into
a piece of international politics. Your testimony is
of the utmost importance—to one—perhaps both of
these gentlemen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“I—I will do what I can to enlighten you,” she said
haltingly. “What do you wish to know?”</p>

<p>General von Stromberg beamed on her.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach</i>, I am glad you take the sensible view of
things.” He waved the package of cigarette papers
in his fingers. “You have seen this object before?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. Will you let me look at it?”</p>

<p>The General moved his chair closer and put the
papers in her fingers. She opened the papers and
finding the message, scanned it closely, reading the
writing with deliberateness and then looking up into
von Stromberg’s face.</p>

<p>“You have seen this before?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At Lady Heathcote’s house in Scotland.”</p>

<p>“How did it come into your hands?”</p>

<p>“I found it on the floor of Mr. Hammersley’s room.”</p>

<p>“The night Herr Rizzio entered it, thinking it was
yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That was the time.”</p>

<p>“You are quite sure?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>“How did you identify it?”</p>

<p>“By certain peculiar characteristics of the handwriting,
with which I am familiar.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Hammersley’s, is it not?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And how did this package of papers go out of
your possession?”</p>

<p>“Mr.—Mr. Hammersley took them from me.”</p>

<p>“By force?”</p>

<p>She raised her chin proudly and looked at her questioner
and then lowered her eyes, replying quietly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“There was another package of cigarette papers of
the same make as these?”</p>

<p>“There was.”</p>

<p>“You read them?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Was this before or after you found the second
package—these which I now have in my hand?”</p>

<p>“Before.”</p>

<p>“How long before?”</p>

<p>“It was the night of Lady Heathcote’s dinner in
London—the night Mr. Hammersley took me home in
the machine.”</p>

<p>“The night you were followed by men in another
machine?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You escaped to Ashwater Park with the package
of papers which Herr Hammersley had given you and,
after hiding in a tree, in the privacy of your room
read these papers?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“Were the contents of the papers you read at Ashwater
Park the same as those you hold in your hand?”</p>

<p>“As nearly as I can remember, they were, exactly.”</p>

<p>“Word for word?”</p>

<p>“I cannot say that. There were certain names and
certain figures that I remember very clearly as being
exactly the same. I—I——” she hesitated. “There
were reasons why, in the state of mind that I was in,
what I saw remained impressed upon my memory.”</p>

<p>Hammersley throughout had sat immovable. But
Rizzio, who had shown signs of anxiety, now interrupted.</p>

<p>“Excellenz, I beg——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Von Stromberg silenced him with a gesture.</p>

<p>“If you will be pleased to continue, Fräulein. Do
you remember the numerals?”</p>

<p>“Some of them.”</p>

<p>“And the towns and dates?”</p>

<p>“Some of them.”</p>

<p>“And are they, the ones that you remember, identical
in both packets?”</p>

<p>“As far as I can remember.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg took the packet from her hands and
turned it over in his fingers.</p>

<p>“There is nothing about this packet, no distinguishing
mark that would make it different from the other,
the one that was burned?”</p>

<p>“None, except the handwriting.”</p>

<p>“H-m.” General von Stromberg put the packet into
an inside pocket and buttoned his coat carefully.</p>

<p>“So far—so good. You are an intelligent witness,
Fräulein.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.” If the words of her questioner contained
an ulterior suggestion, the girl gave every indication
of being oblivious to it, listening with a grave
calmness to his next question.</p>

<p>“When you escaped into the tree, were you in a
position to hear what went on in the road?”</p>

<p>“I was.”</p>

<p>“The men in the road searched Herr Hammersley?”</p>

<p>“They did.”</p>

<p>“And at last he escaped?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Do you remember hearing him shout anything as
his motor moved away?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“That they hadn’t searched the machine or words
to that effect.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg glanced at Rizzio, who was leaning
forward in his chair, eager to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, Herr Rizzio?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That was a diversion—intended to give Miss
Mather more time in which to escape. The second
package was not in the motor. At that time there was
no second package.”</p>

<p>Doris Mather’s voice was raised just a trifle, but for
the moment it dominated.</p>

<p>“There was. Mr. Hammersley put it into the window
sash, when he was in danger of capture.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t he put them both there?”</p>

<p>“I suppose because he wanted to be sure that one
of them would reach its destination.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg grunted. “I see. But why did you
help Mr. Hammersley to save those papers when you
knew that they were dangerous to England?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know what they were. I did what he asked
me to do because—because——”</p>

<p>She faltered.</p>

<p>Von Stromberg waved his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh, very well. It does not matter. Who did you
think was pursuing Mr. Hammersley?”</p>

<p>“Agents of Mr. Rizzio.”</p>

<p>“Why did you think that?”</p>

<p>“Because I heard part of what happened between
Mr. Rizzio and Mr. Hammersley in the smoking-room
at Lady Heathcote’s and I knew that Mr. Rizzio had
threatened Mr. Hammersley.”</p>

<p>“Did you think the men who followed you in the
other machine were German agents?”</p>

<p>Doris answered quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, no. I was sure that they were men of Scotland
Yard.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Subsequent events have proved it to me
conclusively.”</p>

<p>“Oh! What events?”</p>

<p>“The things that Mr. Rizzio did and what he wrote.”</p>

<p>“He wrote—to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Rizzio was swallowing uneasily, his face pale, his
hands trembling.</p>

<p>“Excellenz, I can explain at another time.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg regarded him coolly.</p>

<p>“I will hear you at another time. For the present,
Fräulein Mather will speak. What did Mr. Rizzio
write to you that led you to think that Mr. Rizzio
was in communication with Scotland Yard?”</p>

<p>“This letter, Excellenz.” She put her fingers into
her waist and handed a crumpled paper to the General.
Rizzio had risen again and would have interposed but
von Stromberg waved him aside.</p>

<p>“You will all keep silence until questioned,” he said
abruptly, and then smoothing the letter upon his
knee, read it with great care and deliberateness. Rizzio
made an effort at composure but only succeeded in
bringing out a handkerchief and wiping his brows.
Hammersley watched von Stromberg intently. He was
not aware of the contents of this letter but the attitude
of the girl was distinctly reassuring. Von Stromberg’s
brow puckered disagreeably and his long nose neared
the paper while his eyes peered at the sheet as though
his fiery gaze would burn into it.</p>

<p>He read the paper through twice and then brought
his hand down upon the table with a crash while his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
voice thundered at Rizzio, toward whom he extended
the note.</p>

<p>“It is signed with your initials. Did you write
this?”</p>

<p>Rizzio bent and examined the letter.</p>

<p>“Excellenz, I did, but it was with the object of
bringing Miss Mather to——”</p>

<p>“Silence! Perhaps you do not recall its terms. I
will refresh your memory.”</p>

<p>“Excellenz, if I had not written that letter Miss
Mather would not have——”</p>

<p>“Be quiet. Sit down. Please listen. ‘I am telling
you this,’” he read, “‘to warn you that my generosity
to Hammersley is not actuated by any love of a man
who has spoiled my dearest ambition, but by the continued
esteem with which I still regard yourself. I
do not love him; and my own wish, my duty, my own
honor, my loyalty to England all acclaim that he
should be delivered at once to those in authority. And
yet I have refrained—for you, Doris. But I have
learned that H—— is in communication with G——
and that Crenshaw of Scotland Yard is on the alert.
I may not be able to save him.’”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg paused and laid the letter upon the
table. “I could read more,” he said, “but that is
enough. When did you receive this letter, Fräulein?”</p>

<p>“The day after Mr. Hammersley was shot——”</p>

<p>“And, acting upon it, you went to Ben-a-Chielt to
try to persuade him from the cause of Germany.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said clearly.</p>

<p>“You failed?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“H—m.” The General paused and turned to Rizzio.</p>

<p>“What have you to say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“Merely, Excellenz, that I thought Miss Mather
knew too much for Germany’s good and I chose this
means of getting her to Ben-a-Chielt.”</p>

<p>“Where she could witness a secret meeting between
two officers of my department? Bah! Herr Rizzio,
your story leaks like a sieve. It is full of holes.” He
touched the bell at his elbow and von Winden appeared.
“You will convey Herr Rizzio to the room on the
third floor. Put a guard over him.”</p>

<p>Rizzio started to his feet, his face ghastly, while
beads of moisture stood out upon his forehead.</p>

<p>“You will not give me a chance to explain?” he
protested huskily.</p>

<p>“You will be given a hearing tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“But, Excellenz——”</p>

<p>“Take him away!”</p>

<p>As the door closed behind the two men, General von
Stromberg came forward and took Hammersley by
the hand.</p>

<p>“I am glad, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>, that there is no longer any
suspicion upon you. I have always liked you, Herr
Hammersley, and you have done the Vaterland excellent
service. I am sorry that this investigation was
necessary, but in times like these I am not in a position
to take chances.”</p>

<p>“I understand, Excellenz. But it hasn’t discommoded
me in the least.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg laughed.</p>

<p>“I can readily believe it. You are always as cool
as a morning in May. As for Fräulein Mather,” and
he turned ceremoniously to Doris and bowed deeply,
“it has all been a mistake. If the efforts of a councilor
of the Empire in undoing the wrong done you,
by sending you with every comfort and dispatch to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
England, are any sign of regret, you shall be safely
on the way tomorrow. But I am sure that in your
heart you are glad to have had the opportunity to
clear Herr Hammersley of an unjust suspicion.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she murmured, turning away toward the window.</p>

<p>“But you still wish that the part of Herr Hammersley
which is English had been the greater part of him
instead of the lesser, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nicht wahr</i>?”</p>

<p>She bowed her head but did not reply.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be better if I left you two alone
together. There is doubtless much that you would
say which would be only interesting to yourselves.”</p>

<p>And then he went out, closing the door behind him.</p>

<small>THE GENERAL PLAYS TO WIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">When General von Stromberg went out of the
room Doris turned toward Cyril, her happiness
in her eyes where he could read it
if he wished. But instead of coming to her he made
a warning gesture and then walked slowly around
the room, peering out of the windows and listening at
the doors until satisfied that they were unobserved.
Then he beckoned her to a spot out of the line of
vision of the door into the adjoining room. She
obeyed it wonderingly while he caught her in his arms
and kissed her passionately.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” he whispered, “you understood.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cyril,” she gasped, “if anything had happened
to you——”</p>

<p>“We must be careful,” he went on, whispering
hastily. “My success hangs by a hair. Tonight—the
thing that I came for will be within my reach.
I must have it.”</p>

<p>“There will be danger?”</p>

<p>“I hope not. But you must not trust his promises
to send you away. You must get away from here
tonight before eleven. I will help you. Before then
I must see you alone. It is not safe to talk here.”</p>

<p>He pressed her hand hurriedly and moved slowly
across the room close to the wall and door, which he
examined as he passed.</p>

<p>“But, Cyril——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>A warning finger stopped her.</p>

<p>“There is no use in your trying to persuade me, old
girl,” he said, his voice raised to a tone which seemed
louder than necessary. “I am only doing my duty as
I see it. But whatever happens I can at least remember
that you told the truth.”</p>

<p>What did he mean? She couldn’t understand. She
followed him with her gaze. The fingers of one hand
were tracing the flowers of the wallpaper upon one
side of the room, and as she looked he glanced out of
the window and then got quickly upon a chair and
peered into an aperture in the cornice.</p>

<p>“I am not sorry for Rizzio,” he said again, dusting
off the chair and replacing it. “He only gets what he
deserved. What did he do to you? How did he find
you?”</p>

<p>A glance at his face showed her that he expected her
to reply.</p>

<p>“I was lost on the moor,” she faltered. “I followed
you to Rudha Mor and saw you leave in the Yellow
Dove. When I turned to go back, a cloth was thrown
over my head. They chloroformed me——”</p>

<p>He muttered an imprecation. “And on the
yacht——”</p>

<p>“I—I had nothing to complain of. He did everything
he could for my comfort.”</p>

<p>She watched him again moving around the room.
At the chimney he paused and, reaching swiftly
upward, lifted the clock and then put it into its place
again, the expression in his face still strained and
anxious.</p>

<p>“I am not sorry for him,” he said again. Suddenly
he came to her saying in such a low whisper that she
could hardly hear him,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not satisfied. There’s something dangerous in
von Stromberg’s sudden kindness. <em>Act</em>, Doris. We
are overheard.” And then in louder tones, “If anything
had happened to you——”</p>

<p>She glanced around her timidly, her initiative suddenly
at a loss.</p>

<p>“N-nothing happened to me,” she repeated bewildered.</p>

<p>“I would have made another death for him—a man’s
death at least.”</p>

<p>“It is terrible,” she managed to say, “and I will
have been the cause of it.”</p>

<p>He came closer and took her by the hand, speaking
distinctly.</p>

<p>“And do you regret that it is Rizzio instead of
me?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she stammered. Her accents of horror
were genuine, but it seemed more horrible that she
should be making a farce of her genuine emotions.
Yet Cyril’s eyes impelled her. “It is terrible. I can’t
believe——”</p>

<p>“General von Stromberg is not a man to make idle
threats. I am glad that I am not in Rizzio’s shoes.”</p>

<p>She saw him pause, his mouth open, gazing upward
at the lithograph of Emperor William. To Doris the
picture merely typified power, ambition, intolerance of
any ideals but those of military glory. But it was not
at the portrait that Cyril was looking. He was examining
the frame, which was swung a little to one side,
revealing a patch of unfaded wallpaper. He looked
down into the fireplace thoughtfully and while the girl
wondered what he was going to do next, he whirled
suddenly and moved quickly toward the door into the
hall, which he opened swiftly straight into the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of Captain Wentz, who managed to step back only in
time to avoid it.</p>

<p>But the officer was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>“I was seeking General von Stromberg,” he said
coolly.</p>

<p>“He isn’t here,” Doris heard Cyril say quietly. And
then, “I wanted a glass of water. Fräulein Mather
is feeling ill.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I will have it brought at once.” As he disappeared
in the passage to the kitchen, Cyril closed
the door and came in three strides to the fireplace,
reached up and raised the picture from the wall, peering
under it, and touched the surface of the wallpaper
with the tips of his fingers. Then with great care he
put the picture back in its place and bent over Doris
close to her ear, whispering: “They suspect. Everything
we have said has been overheard. A microphone!
I knew it was here somewhere.”</p>

<p>The pallor of her face when the man from the
kitchen brought the water was almost convincing proof
of the truth of Hammersley’s statement. She did look
ill, for terror of the situation that confronted them
had driven the blood back to her heart. A moment ago
the room had seemed so friendly, and now every object
in it was a menace. And above the mantel the Emperor
of Germany with his upturned mustaches glared
down at her austerely, eloquent of the relentless forces
that held them in their thrall. Behind her she heard
Cyril whispering with the man who had brought the
water and realized that it was the tall soldier with the
lame leg who had brought her toast and eggs upstairs.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Danke sehr</i>, Lindberg,” Cyril said aloud. “She is
tired from the journey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>“Perhaps, Herr Hammersley, a little fresh air will
help. A stroll in the kitchen garden.”</p>

<p>Doris got up in sudden relief as she understood.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “Perhaps I will feel better in the
air.”</p>

<p>Cyril led the way to the door and together they went
out. They heard sounds of heavy footsteps in the
hallway above but did not pause, making their way
along the path which led around the house. Cyril did
not turn toward her, but she heard him speaking.</p>

<p>“They will call us back. Do not be frightened. If
von Stromberg questions again, answer to the best of
your ability. I will find a means of reaching your
room tonight. In the meanwhile keep up your courage.”</p>

<p>She did not reply for she heard steps behind her,
and turning, found Captain Wentz, who bowed, taking
off his cap.</p>

<p>“General von Stromberg requests me to ask,” he said
in very good English, “if Miss Mather will not give
him the pleasure of joining him in a cup of chocolate.”</p>

<p>“He is very kind,” she said slowly with a glance at
Cyril. “Of course—I shall be very glad.”</p>

<p>The officer replaced his cap and, turning to Hammersley,
spoke in German.</p>

<p>“His Excellenz also requests that Herr Hammersley
will remain within call.”</p>

<p>Hammersley bowed.</p>

<p>“Tell his Excellenz with my compliments that with
his permission I will smoke my pipe here in the kitchen
garden.”</p>

<p>Doris followed the officer into the room they had just
left and von Stromberg joined her almost immediately.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach, gnädiges Fräulein</i>,” he said with his blandest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
manner, “you will forgive me for calling you back from
your contemplation of the beauties of this lovely afternoon,
but there are certain questions, merely trifling
ones, which have to do with the fate of Herr Rizzio
which I neglected to ask you. You will not begrudge
an old man the privilege of a few words over a cup
of chocolate?”</p>

<p>She smiled at him bravely, as a woman can do, even
in a last extremity, and told him that she was flattered
by this mark of his condescension.</p>

<p>A wave of the hand and Wentz disappeared, while
Lindberg, the lame man, entered with the chocolate.
The General had the tray put upon the table before
her and asked her to serve it, standing erect and
watching her with open admiration. Doris was frightened,
for she had already seen the power that this old
man possessed. But with an effort she found her composure
and made up her mind that if she was alarmed
von Stromberg at least should not be aware of it. The
safest defense against such a man was audacity.</p>

<p>“You were feeling ill,” he said, suavely sympathetic.
“The long morning in the train and the strain of your
ordeal. It is but natural. A little cup of chocolate
and a biscuit should revive you wonderfully. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nicht
wahr?</i>” His English, though excellent, had a slight
German accent and his tone the quality of a lullaby,</p>

<p>“It is very good,” said Doris. “I have often heard
it said that nowhere in the world is chocolate so excellent
as in Germany.”</p>

<p>“I trust that you may find it so. There are many
things beside chocolate that are excellent in Germany,
Fräulein Mather.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that must be true,” she said politely,
touching the cup to her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then why do you dislike us so much?” he asked
with a smile.</p>

<p>“It is not your people that I dislike so much,
General von Stromberg. Many of the most charming
people I have ever known have been Germans. It is
not what you are, but what you want to be, that I dislike;
not your habits or your tastes, but your intolerance
of any civilization which happens to differ from
yours.”</p>

<p>She paused, a little frightened at her temerity, but
von Stromberg still smiled.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he chuckled, “you speak very prettily.”</p>

<p>“I am an American, General von Stromberg, from
the United States, where people are accustomed to
speak what they feel, without fear of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lèse majesté</i>.
If the President of the United States did something
that I didn’t like I would write him a letter.”</p>

<p>“And would he answer it?” he purred.</p>

<p>“If he had time, yes. If anyone wrote such a letter
to your Emperor, he would be boiled in oil.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg roared with delight. “Boiled in oil!”
he repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes—or perhaps some more exquisite cruelty that
your ingenious people have devised,” she said coolly.
“To prosaic minds like mine, Excellenz, you Germans
are the wonders of the age. You are both godlike and
Saturnian; a nation of military fanatics, a nation of
silly sentimentalists; a nation trained to scientific brutality,
which shares the sorrows of the dying rose.
Which is it that you want us to think you, the god or
the satyr?”</p>

<p>“We know that we are the god,” he said, showing his
teeth, “but we want you to think us the satyr.”</p>

<p>“You have succeeded, Excellenz,” she replied calmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
“It is very pleasant to be sitting here drinking chocolate
with a <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geheimrath</i>—a councilor of the Empire—but
you’ll pardon me if I say that the peculiarly social
pleasure of the occasion is somewhat marred by the
fact that if the whim happened to strike you you could
have me strung up by the thumbs.”</p>

<p>“You think that I am cruel? <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach</i>, no, Fräulein.
You are mistaken,” in his blandest tones. “I have a
daughter in East Prussia of just your age. For that
reason I would like to have you think of me a little
as the sentimentalist rather than as the—the brute—as
you have been pleased to suggest. I am not cruel
and I shall prove it to you.”</p>

<p>“In America, Excellenz, we do not make war upon
women.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I make war upon you,” he put in quickly.
“I did not bring you to Germany, Fräulein. Herr
Rizzio acted upon his own responsibility. Even yet, if
he is an English agent, I cannot understand his purpose
in bringing such an incriminating document.”</p>

<p>He smiled as he spoke, but she felt the question and
its threat. For a moment the directness of his attack
bewildered her and so she sipped her chocolate to gain
a moment of time.</p>

<p>“General von Stromberg,” she said at last, as the
idea came to her, “I am told that you have one of the
keenest intellects in the Empire of Germany. I feel
much like a child before you, who should see matters
much more clearly than I. There were two reasons
why he brought me, one of which bears upon our personal
relations, the other upon his relation to England.
I knew that he possessed your confidence, otherwise
he would not have been in possession of a document
which empowered Mr. Hammersley to give up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
secret message of Captain Byfield. I knew too much.
If I had told my friends in England what I knew,
his utility to England would have been gone.”</p>

<p>“Why? It seems to me that having my confidence
would have made his utility to England the greater.”</p>

<p>“He would have been suspected of double dealing,
would he not?”</p>

<p>“As a friend of England you would have let him
be suspected?” he asked quietly. “Given evidence
against a man whom you knew to be acting in England’s
interests?”</p>

<p>“There were other—other—interests,” she faltered,
“more important to me than England’s—Mr. Hammersley’s.
You have a daughter, Excellenz. Perhaps
you would try to think of me as you would think of her
in a similar situation. When I read those papers at
Ashwater Park I knew that the man to whom I was
promised and of whom I had always thought as an
Englishman was acting as a secret agent—a spy of
Germany. He was pursued by agents of the English
War Office. I knew that if his connection with Germany
were discovered he would be shot. I was frightened. I
did not know what to do. John Rizzio followed me to
Scotland and tried to get the papers. I refused to
give them to him. And then when—when Mr. Hammersley
came I burned them. There was nothing
left for me to do—for England—for him. If there
were no papers there could be no evidence against
him.”</p>

<p>She paused to get her breath, aware that her companion
was listening intently, and fearfully afraid that
she was saying too much.</p>

<p>“And then—?” he asked.</p>

<p>“And then,” she went on more slowly, “I found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
other papers. When I wouldn’t give them to him,
Mr. Hammersley took them away from me. We quarreled,
Excellenz, and I gave him up.”</p>

<p>“And after that—”</p>

<p>“After that came Mr. Rizzio’s note asking me to
go to Ben-a-Chielt and see the meeting between Cyr—between
Mr. Hammersley and your messenger in the
last hope that I could make Mr. Hammersley give
up his plans to deliver the message to you. As you
know I failed. It was there—after that—that Mr.
Rizzio, who had overheard our conversation, tried to
kill Mr. Hammersley, knowing that he had resolved
to deliver the message.” She got up and paced the
floor. “Oh, it is so clear, what Rizzio was, that I
wonder that it should be necessary for me to tell it to
you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see. And the other—the personal reasons
you mentioned.”</p>

<p>She hesitated. “It is difficult to speak of them—but
I will tell you. Mr. Rizzio has forfeited all right
to my loyalty. He offered to marry me. I refused
him. He told me he would never give me up. In
Scotland he threatened Cyril—Mr. Hammersley’s life.
I know now what he meant.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but in his letter to you he does not threaten.
He urges that he is doing what he can to save Hammersley!”</p>

<p>“I did not believe him. I was right. Events have
proved it. He would have been glad to see Mr. Hammersley
out of the way.” She covered her face with
her hands and sank into her chair again. “Oh,” she
whispered, “it is horrible—horrible. And it is I who
must be the instrument of justice.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg waited for a moment, tapping one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
finger of his left hand very slowly upon the back of
his right.</p>

<p>“Try to compose yourself, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">liebes Fräulein</i>,” he urged
calmly, and, as she looked up at him: “You say he
wanted to be rid of Herr Hammersley. Can you tell
me then, why his men did not shoot him when they had
him prisoner at Ashwater Park gates?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. Perhaps they would have done so
if he hadn’t escaped.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg paused again, and then, gently:</p>

<p>“You love Herr Hammersley a great deal, Fräulein?”</p>

<p>She bent her gaze upon him appealingly.</p>

<p>“Would I now be here, Excellenz?” she asked.</p>

<p>Von Stromberg bent his head and then got up and
slowly paced the length of the room. When he returned
there was another note in his voice. It was
still quiet but the legato note had gone, and it was
ice-cold.</p>

<p>“You do well to tell your story through the medium
of sentiment which you well understand, rather than
through the medium of logic, which you do not understand,
which no woman understands.”</p>

<p>At his change of tone she glanced up. He was leering
at her unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“I do not know what you mean,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“You are very clever, Fräulein, but your story has
a great many holes in it—little holes which might grow
into big ones, if one were disposed to enlarge them.
There are several things which are not at all clear
to me. Of course it must be as apparent to you as it
is to me that if Herr Rizzio was an English agent, by
remaining in England he had nothing to fear from
you or anyone else. His object, too, in bringing you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to Germany is clear. As you say, you knew too much,
not about his connection with the English War Office,
which, of course, would not matter in the least, but
about Herr Rizzio’s connection with <em>me</em>, which would
have mattered a great deal.”</p>

<p>He tapped his long forefinger upon his breast significantly
and leaned forward ominously across the
table. He dominated, hypnotized her. She closed her
eyes, trembling violently.</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you do not believe? His letter,
Excellenz—surely you believe that to be genuine?”</p>

<p>“Bait, Fräulein—that is all. Excellent bait. You
swallowed it. Herr Hammersley very cleverly prepared
himself against surprise. Only the fortunate
accident of your losing yourself upon the moor saved
Herr Rizzio from failure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are all wrong. You are willfully making
me suffer. I have told the truth.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg straightened and drew from his
pocket a military telegraph form which he smoothed
out gently with his long, bony fingers.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately for Herr Hammersley I have just
received a message from another agent in London—in
whom I have implicit faith. You read German a
little. Would you care to see it?”</p>

<p>He laid it upon the table before her eyes and she
looked, her eyes distended with terror of she knew
now what.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hammersley caused arrest of Byfield. Has informed
on Rizzio and myself. Am in hiding in Kent. Will
reach Germany by usual methods. <span class="flright smcap">Maxwell.</span><br />
</p>
</div>

<p class="p1">Doris sat immovable, petrified with horror. Von
Stromberg’s voice crackled harshly at her ear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well? And what have you to say?”</p>

<p>“It is a lie!” she managed to stammer. “He lies—lies,
I tell you!”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach!</i> If I could believe you! Why should he lie?
Unlike the case of Rizzio, Herr Hammersley has not
robbed Herr Maxwell of a bride.”</p>

<p>“There is a mistake——”</p>

<p>“I fear not.”</p>

<p>“But why should Mr. Hammersley have come? He
would have been safe in England——”</p>

<p>“He himself says to the contrary——”</p>

<p>She was breaking fast and he sought further to
involve her.</p>

<p>“He did not have to come. Why should he have
come?” she asked wildly, rising to her feet and laying
her hands upon his arm. “Answer me that, Excellenz.”</p>

<p>For reply he turned away from her abruptly and
walked the length of the room to an end window,
where he stood for a moment looking out.</p>

<p>“Come, Fräulein, and I will show you something.”</p>

<p>She approached him blindly and followed his gaze
around the corner of the building. Upon a tree
stump in the kitchen garden, looking out across the
fields toward the wooded hills sat Hammersley, calmly
smoking.</p>

<p>“Half of his blood is English, half Prussian, Fräulein,
but it is the English in him that dominates. Is
there anything that is Prussian about him? Tell me.
From the crown of his head to the sole of his foot—his
pipe, his bent shoulders, his careless air—he is
English, all English. He knows that at this moment
I am weighing his fate in the balance and yet he
smokes his short wooden pipe. If he has Prussian
blood it is a pity, for Germany needs all the Prussian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
blood that flows red in the veins of men.” He paused
and then abruptly, “But the Prussian blood must be
sacrificed with the English——”</p>

<p>She fell back from him, deathly white, groping for
a chair to support her.</p>

<p>“You mean——” she whispered.</p>

<p>“That I can take no chances. He will be shot tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“O God! He is loyal to Germany. I swear it.”
Her utterance was choked. Her breath came with
difficulty. The room darkened suddenly and she seemed
about to swoon. She dropped to her knees beside the
armchair, clinging to it, trying to speak, but no words
would come. She was aware of his hawk-like face bending
over her as though in the act of striking its prey
and she heard his voice at her ear.</p>

<p>“There is one chance to save him.”</p>

<p>She reached his hand and clung to it.</p>

<p>“A chance—what—”</p>

<p>“Tell me the truth,” he said sternly.</p>

<p>“I—I have told you the truth. He is innocent.”</p>

<p>He loosened her fingers and stood away.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Quatsch!</i>” he muttered, leaning forward. “The
truth, girl!”</p>

<p>“He is——” The words choked her. “He is——”</p>

<p>“Bah!” he growled, moving toward the table. “You
have already convicted him!”</p>

<p>She struggled to her feet and followed him. He was
about to touch the bell when she caught his arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>“Wait!” she whispered. “What guarantee have I
that he will not be injured?”</p>

<p>He shrugged and laughed. “I need give no guarantee
now, Fräulein. This is not a court of law! I am
the judge of what constitutes proof. You have testified.”</p>

<p>He shook her off and sounded the bell, which was
immediately answered by Udo von Winden.</p>

<p>“You will conduct Fräulein Mather to her room upstairs.
Lock the door and bring me the key. Then
tell Herr Hammersley that I am waiting to see him.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">When Hammersley entered the house with von
Winden he was immediately aware that a
crisis had come in his affairs, for in the hall
leading to the living-room stood Captain Wentz and
two soldiers, and when he was shown into von Stromberg’s
presence, the Councilor stood with his back
to the hearth, his long legs wide apart, his hands behind
his back and the expression of his long, bony face
was not pleasant to see. He smiled and frowned at
the same time—a smile which possessed so few of the
ingredients of humor that the tangled brows even
seemed less ominous. Doris was nowhere to be seen.
Hammersley made no sign of his prescience of trouble.
He put his pipe in the pocket of his leather jacket,
strolled forward into the room and stood at attention.
“Search him!” snapped von Stromberg. And when von
Winden had finished, “Leave us,” he said to the officer,
“and keep within call, I shall need you presently.”
He waited until the door was closed and then turned
to Hammersley somberly.</p>

<p>“Your jig is danced, Herr Hammersley, Fräulein
Mather has confessed.”</p>

<p>“Confessed what, Excellenz?” questioned Hammersley
calmly.</p>

<p>“She has told the truth.”</p>

<p>“Of course, that was to be expected of her.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” roared the General. “There’s no need of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
more of that. She told me that you were an English
spy.”</p>

<p>Hammersley started forward, the only expression
on his face one of complete incredulity. “Fräulein
Mather told you that? Impossible!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you don’t believe me?”</p>

<p>Hammersley managed a smile.</p>

<p>“It would hardly be good ethics for me to say that.
I simply repeat that it is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Von Stromberg sneered.</p>

<p>“Because it is morally impossible for her to tell an
untruth.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach</i>, so. But it is <em>physically</em> impossible for her
to keep from <em>not</em> doing so.” He leaned forward, grinning
craftily. “In the small games of life, in the things
which amount to nothing, women lie with a careless
skill that is amazing, but in a game of life and death,
their little tricks are negligible. Pouf! Herr Hammersley,
did you expect to match mere falsehood and
such a tissue of flimsy evidence against a man of my
experience? It was a desperate game from the beginning—one
which could have had only one end. You
have been clever—very, very clever. In time, perhaps,
under proper guidance and with the necessary political
opinions, you could have succeeded in becoming a very
useful helper of the Universe, through the medium of
the Secret Service Department of the German Empire.
But such cleverness is superficial and quickly
burns out in the hotter fire of genius. I would like you
to know—”</p>

<p>“One moment, Excellenz,” put in Hammersley
coolly. “Am I to understand from your attitude that
you believe I am false to the Vaterland?”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“You still insist on acting out the part?”</p>

<p>Hammersley did not answer the question. Instead
he asked, “Will you be good enough to tell me upon
what new evidence you base your present position?”</p>

<p>The Councilor strode to the table and thrust the
telegraphic message he had shown to the girl under
Hammersley’s nose.</p>

<p>“This,” he growled. “I will read it to you. ‘Hammersley
caused arrest of Byfield. Has informed on
Rizzio and myself——’ It’s signed ‘Maxwell.’ What
do you think of my evidence?” He grinned, “Convincing,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nicht wahr</i>?”</p>

<p>Hammersley looked up into von Stromberg’s face
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Not even in code, Excellenz? It is a pity you did
not write it in English. But under the circumstances
you can’t expect me to take any interest in such a
trick.”</p>

<p>“Not you, Herr Hammersley,” he chuckled. “It is
not necessary that you should believe in it. In fact
there are reasons why you shouldn’t believe in it, the
most important reason being that Herr Maxwell is
dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!”</p>

<p>“Obviously. You condemned him and he was put in
prison. If he is not dead it is through no fault of
yours.”</p>

<p>Hammersley smiled. “You cannot get me to acquiesce
in such strange statements.”</p>

<p>“I do not ask you to acquiesce. I could not expect
to catch Herr Hammersley by a trick. But Miss
Mather was less difficult.”</p>

<p>Hammersley’s jaws set. “I understand. But do
you mean to say that I can be incriminated by a confession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
made under the stress of a terror artificially
produced?”</p>

<p>“That is a clever turn of phrase, Herr Hammersley,
worthy of the high regard with which I hold your
abilities. In reply I can only say that in time of war
my deductions in all matters connected with my department
are final. You are an English spy, Herr
Hammersley, and you are quite aware of the penalty.”</p>

<p>Hammersley raised his head and folded his arms.
“Quite,” he replied, “if you choose to take that action.
I can only say that the time will come when you will
regret it.”</p>

<p>“I must take that chance, for there will be no trial.”</p>

<p>Hammersley shrugged his shoulders and turned
aside. His face was white and the muscles at his jaws
worked for a moment, but otherwise he gave no sign
of emotion. General von Stromberg had gone back to
his favorite pose by the mantel and Hammersley again
heard his voice.</p>

<p>“It seems a pity, Herr Hammersley, that after all
it should be you instead of Herr Rizzio who is the
culprit. You are a type of young man very much
to my liking, and the position of the young lady is
unpleasant in the extreme. She has served her purpose
here and I shall, of course, take immediate steps to
have her returned to her own people.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Hammersley dryly.</p>

<p>“But the thing that has interested me in your case
from the first,” he continued with a return of his mastodonic
playfulness, “and indeed still continues to interest
me, is why you should choose to return to Germany
when you knew that you were under suspicion.
Surely you did not come here to pick cowslips in
March? Come now, I could have you shot this afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
if I chose. Tell me the truth and I will promise
to postpone the affair until tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Hammersley studied the pattern in the rug thoughtfully
for a moment, and at last he straightened and
shrugged again.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose there is any use playing the game
further. Since I am to go, it doesn’t matter if I tell
you. I have planned for some time to be able to get
plans of the recent additions to the fortifications of
Strassburg.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach, so.</i> Strassburg! And what, may I ask, were
to be your means of procuring them?”</p>

<p>“That, of course, since my utility has ceased, cannot
possibly be of interest to you.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg studied him narrowly for a long moment
and then wagged his head sagely. It was an
unnecessary suspicion that he had cherished. This had
been a case with interesting aspects, but after all it
was not much out of the usual way. An English spy
betrayed by the simplest of tricks upon the credulity
and affection of a woman. He thought that Hammersley
had been after bigger game. Plans, fortifications—the
same objects, the same methods. Von Stromberg
had tried to puzzle out in the mazes of his wonderful
brain the possible chance that this man could have
had of learning of the whereabouts of Herr Gottschalk’s
memoranda and of the momentous decision
which had been reached in the Wilhelmstrasse with
regard to them. He studied Hammersley closely, with
something approaching regret that the contest between
them could not have been waged at greater length and
for higher stakes. He felt a genuine human sorrow at
this moment over the impending fate of this handsome
young man who was only doing his duty for the fatuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
English. It was too bad. But there was much
else to do. Tomorrow his mission in this part of the
Empire would be ended and the Wilhelmstrasse was
calling. He touched the bell upon the table and Captain
Wentz entered.</p>

<p>“Herr Hammersley is to be taken to the room on
the third floor. Tonight you will see that he is securely
bound and a guard set over him, within the
room. You will place another guard outside below
his window. If he tries to escape, shoot him.”</p>

<p>Wentz spoke to the man in the hall and Hammersley,
between them, was led to the foot of the steps,
and followed his captors to the upper story. He
knew, in view of the instructions that he had overheard,
that any effort to escape would be fruitless.
He sat on the edge of the bed submitting calmly while
his feet and hands were bound under the direction of
Captain Wentz; after which the officers went out, leaving
a man to guard him, and locked the door. Hammersley
rolled over on the bed and lay for a long while
staring at the wall. The day was fading into dusk.
Five o’clock, it might be, Hammersley guessed. Six
hours or less remained to him in which to act. Six
hours in which he must lie helpless while the one chance
of intercepting the messenger from Berlin came and
passed. He lay perfectly still as he had fallen, but
his spirit writhed in agony.</p>

<p>Doris was in a room near him, likewise a prisoner,
aware of the fate in store for him and able to do
nothing but wait as he would wait until the shots were
fired below there in the garden, which would be the
end of all things for him. He found that he was thinking
little of himself. It was Doris and what she must
be suffering that occupied the moments of his thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
which were not given to the remote chances of escape.</p>

<p>His bonds were tightly drawn—a rope tied with German
thoroughness. He moved his hands behind him
and tried to gain a little room for his present ease.
If he was to be shot tomorrow morning it would have
seemed indeed a small charity to have permitted him to
pass his last night in some degree of comfort. Could
it be that, after all, von Stromberg suspected the real
object of his return? That hardly seemed possible;
for his informant in Berlin, a woman close to those in
high authority, had made every move with the utmost
discretion and his own relations to Lindberg could not
possibly be suspected.</p>

<p>Lindberg! Hammersley turned and looked at his
guard who was standing motionless by the window,
gazing out at the fading landscape. Lindberg was his
one, his last desperate hope. Udo von Winden, his
cousin— It was too much to hope that Udo would be
of service to him. He had caught a glimpse of Udo’s
face in the hallway downstairs when von Stromberg’s
orders were given. He had gone pale and stared at
him in pity and horror as Hammersley had gone up
the stairs, but Hammersley knew that the ties of kinship,
the memories of their boyhood together, were
nothing beside the iron will and indomitable authority
of the great man who had condemned him. Udo would
suffer when Hammersley died, for there had been a
time when the two had been much to each other, but
he would do his duty, however painful, as a small unit
of the relentless machine which Hammersley had had
the temerity to oppose. What else could be expected?</p>

<p>A word, a sign, the slightest aid to such a prisoner,
and he would be as guilty as his cousin. Hammersley
knew that he did Udo no injustice in supposing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
any help from such a source was out of the question.
If Udo had been caught in England as Hammersley
was caught in Germany, Hammersley knew that he
could do nothing to save him.</p>

<p>But Lindberg! Here the case was different. It
was Lindberg whose life Hammersley had saved three
years ago in this very forest, when the Forester had
stumbled and fallen in the path of an angry boar who
would have gored him to death, if Hammersley had not
shot the beast. Lindberg the Forester it was, who, in
his hours off duty, had been Hammersley’s chosen companion
in many a hunt up through the rocky gorges
of these very mountains, every stick and stone of which
he knew as he knew his own rugged face in the mirror.
It was Lindberg who had been so useful in keeping
him informed of the exact state of affairs at Blaufelden.
It was Lindberg who had learned of the microphone
that von Stromberg had installed and it was
Lindberg who had listened at the receiver upstairs in
von Stromberg’s room to the conversation when the
Councilor had told Captain Wentz the nature of the
documents from Berlin and the hour of their arrival.</p>

<p>Already Lindberg had repaid a hundredfold the debt
of Hammersley’s service and it was quite possible, now
that Hammersley’s actual mission had been discovered,
that he would take to cover, his mind clear in the
thought that he had done all that could be expected
of him. But there was a warm affection between the
two, born of many a long day in the open and many a
night by the campfire where the old man had taught
him the Foresters’ secrets of the trees, the birds in
their branches and of the many four-legged things
that scurried beneath them. They had often talked,
too, of many other things, and Hammersley had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
learned that Lindberg’s politics were those that one
learns under the open sky—the eternal peace of Nature,
before which war and men, its armed instruments,
were a blasphemy.</p>

<p>Perhaps Lindberg would find a way. But what way?
How? Udo von Winden, too, was aware of the woodcraft
fellowship, for often he had made their duet a
trio. Hammersley knew that Udo von Winden as yet
suspected nothing of the services Lindberg had rendered
him and he wondered whether in this pass the
ties of kinship would be strong enough to keep him
silent as to the possible capabilities of the old Forester
for mischief in Hammersley’s behalf.</p>

<p>Hammersley hoped. He clung to the thought of
Lindberg’s fidelity and affection as a dying man clings
to the hope of Heaven. He tried to analyze the old
man’s capacities for sympathy and courage. To help
a man in his position seemed to require larger stores
of both of these qualities than human clay was molded
for. Lindberg did not fear death, he knew, but the
death he courted was the kind of death Hammersley
had saved him from, a good death in a fair game with
a noble enemy, not the kind of death that awaited
Hammersley, a cold, machine-made death against a
kitchen wall. And he must know as Hammersley knew
that this was what would follow.</p>

<p>The dusk faded into dark and the soldier lit a candle.
Hammersley turned his head and examined him attentively.
His face was unfamiliar at Blaufelden, one of
the men probably sent down at von Stromberg’s orders
from the upper district to be useful in just this emergency.
Von Stromberg would make no mistakes, of
course. He never did make mistakes. He had enough
men about him to cope with the situation safely. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
would leave no opportunity for his plans to miscarry.
Any opportunity, should there be one, must be created.
Hammersley managed to wriggle into a sitting posture
on the bed and spoke to his captor in German.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t mind my having a smoke, would
you?” he asked.</p>

<p>The man looked at him, debating the matter.</p>

<p>“Just get into the side pocket of my jacket and
fish out my pipe and tobacco, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein junger</i>. I need a
smoke badly. And so would you if you were going
to be shot in the morning.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach, wohl.</i> I see no harm in that, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>.
You cannot smoke yourself away.”</p>

<p>He came over, brought out Hammersley’s short pipe,
filled it from the pouch and stuck it between his lips.
Then he got out a match and lighted it while Hammersley
puffed.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Hammersley contentedly. “You are a
good fellow. Tomorrow morning I will give you my
blessing.”</p>

<p>The man paced stolidly up and down beside the bed.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for you, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>. But it is life. It
is all decided for us beforehand. We are here a moment
and then we are gone.”</p>

<p>Hammersley smiled.</p>

<p>“A fatalist! Then perhaps you can tell me if there
is any chance of my escape.”</p>

<p>He was stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>“I can tell you that there is not,” he said severely.</p>

<p>“I would have said as much. But it was a pardonable
curiosity, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nicht wahr</i>?”</p>

<p>“Pardonable, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">ja wohl</i>,” the man replied, “but most
unseemly under the circumstances.”</p>

<p>“You have a deep sense of your responsibilities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja.</i> I obey my orders, that is all. I do not care
what others do.”</p>

<p>“Therefore you will shoot me tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he shrugged. “I am but an instrument
of Providence.” He waved his hand. “But I talk too
much, and so do you. It is not seemly in a soldier
and a prisoner.”</p>

<p>Hammersley laughed. “You have a fine sense of the
fitness of things.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja.</i> It was so written.”</p>

<p>He relapsed into silence and in spite of efforts on
Hammersley’s part refused to speak further. It was
only after Hammersley badgered him for his unsociability
that he spoke with some asperity.</p>

<p>“I will trouble you to be quiet. When I am relieved,
my successor may let you speak and laugh as much
as you please. But it is unnatural in a man at the
point of death. It would be better if you were saying
your prayers.”</p>

<p>“I am sure that you are right. But I still have a
few hours. Perhaps you wouldn’t mind telling me the
hour at which you are to be relieved—the hour when
we are both of us to be relieved?”</p>

<p>The man gazed at him uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>“After supper.” He finished indifferently, “Eight
o’clock, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Hammersley was silent. Two hours or more to wait
before a change of guards, and then only a chance that
Lindberg would be able to do something. Even then
if he managed to get loose, there was left little more
than an hour in which to reach the road by which
the machine would come from Berlin, and even then
what should he do without Doris? His case was desperate.
Only a miracle it seemed could make a success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of what had been a pitiful failure; only an act of
Providence could save him from the discreditable end
that awaited him.</p>

<p>He drew up his knees and studied the knots at his
ankles. His guardian was the one who had tied them.</p>

<p>“You tie a good square knot, my friend. You were
once a sailor?”</p>

<p>But nothing would induce the soldier to talk.</p>

<p>As the supper hour approached, Hammersley could
hear the rattle of pans and dishes downstairs and noticed
the odor of coffee. They would not starve him,
of course. In a little while someone would come with
food. After a while, which seemed interminable, the
noise of the rattling dishes ceased and there was a
sound at the door into the hall as the key turned in
the lock and Captain Wentz entered. His sturdy back
had never seemed so ugly nor so welcome, for the
silence and the inaction were getting on Hammersley’s
nerves. The officer came over to the bed and gravely
examined the knots of the rope that bound the prisoner.
Then, satisfied with the results of his inspection,
he straightened and glanced around the room.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gut</i>,” he muttered. And then to the soldier: “You
will go down and tell Lindberg to bring Herr Hammersley’s
supper. I will stay here in the meanwhile.
You will then relieve the man at the door of his Excellenz.”</p>

<p>The man saluted and departed. They still trusted
Lindberg. Then Udo had suspected nothing, or if he
had suspected, had kept his thoughts to himself. Hammersley
lay back on the pillow preparing a stolid indifference
for Lindberg’s entrance. And when the meal
was brought, Wentz untied his hands and stood over
him with an automatic while he ate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your weapon makes a poor relish, Herr Hauptmann,”
said Hammersley with a laugh.</p>

<p>“I greatly regret its necessity,” replied Wentz with
his machine-made politeness.</p>

<p>Hammersley ventured nothing further, eating silently,
and with a surprising appetite, for good Lindberg’s
face in the background had given him new
courage. When the meal was done, he asked for his
pipe again and Wentz ordered the Forester to fill it.
Hammersley inhaled the smoke and exhaled a sigh.</p>

<p>“So far as I am concerned, Herr Hauptmann,” he
said with a smile, “when this pipe is finished you may
kill me at once.”</p>

<p>He extended his wrists behind him in silence while
Captain Wentz took half a dozen turns of the rope
and made it fast. Hammersley sat up in bed puffing
at his pipe and wondering whether some miracle might
not be induced that would kill Wentz. But he was
quickly disillusioned, for when Lindberg took the
dishes and moved toward the door, he heard Wentz’s
crisp orders:</p>

<p>“You will send Max Senf to take the first night
watch upon the prisoner. He is awaiting my orders
in the guard room. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schnell.</i>”</p>

<p>Without even a glance at the prisoner Lindberg
saluted and went out and Hammersley’s spirits fell.
Help from Lindberg was impossible. Von Stromberg
was taking every precaution. There was no way out
of it. Hammersley was doomed. But while Wentz
was in the room he kept a cheerful countenance, though
for the first time in his life that he could remember
his pipe was acrid. He saw the new guard enter and
heard the last orders of the officer.</p>

<p>“You will watch until one o’clock when your relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
will be sent. The prisoner is to be allowed no privileges.
Under no circumstances are his hands to be
untied. If he wants water, you will give it to him
with your own hands. <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Verstehen sie?</i>”</p>

<p>The man stood erect and saluted. “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Zu befehl, Herr
Hauptmann</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>Hammersley saw the door close and heard the key
turn in the lock while Senf came forward into the
room and stood by the foot of the bed. Hammersley
studied him closely: a tall, loosely jointed man in his
early thirties with the heavy brows and high cheekbones
of the East Prussian, the face of a Slav, almost,
with something of the thoughtful intensity of the South
German mystic. His eyes were large, his nose thin and
his face was bearded, but the lines of his mouth had
a sensitive curve, belied by the big bony hands and
broad shoulders. A sentimentalist, perhaps!</p>

<p>Hammersley determined to try him, for a plan had
been forming in his mind. He had noticed with a
glance which had included everything in the room when
he entered, a Bible upon the mantelshelf, and in a
tone which had in it a solemn sense of the doom which
awaited him in the morning, he addressed his guardian
quietly:</p>

<p>“Senf, you have a kind face. There is a small favor
that you may do me.”</p>

<p>“If it does not conflict with my orders.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. Tomorrow morning I am to be shot.
All I ask is that you will allow me to read for a while
the Bible upon the chimneypiece.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach!</i> I see no harm in that.”</p>

<p>He went over and got the book, opening the pages
and looking through them.</p>

<p>“It is little enough for a dying man to ask,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Danke</i>,” said Hammersley quietly, his face solemn
but his mind working rapidly. “It is but right to
make one’s peace with the world at a time like
this.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Herr</i>,” said the man mournfully.
“It is not good for a man to die in the first flush of
youth.”</p>

<p>“If it could only have been in the open, Senf, a
soldier’s death, but this—<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach, wohl</i>—we can only go
once. It doesn’t matter.” He gave a deep sigh and
asked his guardian to light his pipe again and open
the Book at the Psalms of David.</p>

<p>“I cannot turn the pages, my friend. It is a pity.
But propped upon one elbow I can see quite well if
you will but put the candle here upon the bed.”</p>

<p>The man did as requested and Hammersley thanked
him.</p>

<p>“You are a kind fellow. It is bread upon the waters.
You will find it after many days.”</p>

<p>“It is nothing. I would expect as much from another.”</p>

<p>“Now, if you will permit, I would prefer the solitude
of my thoughts.”</p>

<p>The soldier turned slowly away and Hammersley
bent his gaze upon the open page, but he did not read.
He was thinking, planning, watching the movements
of Max Senf. Eight o’clock was long past. It must
be nearly nine. But two hours remained before the
arrival of the messenger from Berlin. His guardian
paced slowly up and down the room between the door
and window, and Hammersley felt, if he did not see, his
deep bovine gaze fixed upon him from time to time.
Eight or ten times the man took the length of the room
and then with a deep sigh he sank into the chair at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
foot of the bed. Hammersley did not move his head,
which remained bent forward over the book, but from
the tail of his eye he noted that the tall footboard of
the old-fashioned bed partially concealed him. Propped
up as he was he could see the man’s head as far down as
the tip of his nose, but all of his head was in shadow.
Arguing from this, everything upon the bed below the
line of the flame of the candle was invisible to him.
But a quick glance showed Hammersley that the man
was not looking at him. His dark eyes were peering
straight before him at the opposite wall and his mind
was wrapped in some gloomy vision.</p>

<p>The plan he had in mind required subtlety. He
marked the shadows upon the ceiling and moved up in
the bed so that his own shadow would be thrown behind
the line of sight of his guardian. Then he paused
again, his eyes fixed on the pages, waiting for Senf to
look at him again. He heard the man move in his
chair, which creaked as he settled more comfortably
into it. And when Hammersley looked again, only
his eyes were visible, their gaze fixed darkly ahead of
him.</p>

<p>Hammersley now puffed a volume of smoke from his
pipe and slowly wriggled his left arm forward under
him, so that he could see the knot that tied his wrists.
It was a large knot, but vulnerable. He puffed more
smoke, meanwhile watching the top of the head of
Senf. As it did not move, he lay over half upon his
back, and, taking care not to disturb the book, slowly
advanced his arms behind him toward the blaze of the
candle. The knot of the rope caught and blazed, but
the candle sputtered, and he quickly withdrew his
hands, sending a volume of smoke from his pipe to neutralize
the odor. Senf sniffed the air curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>“Something is burning,” Hammersley heard him
mutter.</p>

<p>“My pipe,” he explained carefully. “It is a vile tobacco.
But it will go out of the crack at the window.”</p>

<p>“Will you not try mine, Herr Hammersley? Perhaps
it is better.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. Nothing much matters to a dead
man.”</p>

<p>His guardian settled back in his chair, and Hammersley
repeated his maneuver more daringly, his own
pipe seething like a furnace.</p>

<p>“You are a furious smoker, Herr Hammersley,”
said Senf again.</p>

<p>“It is the way one smokes, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">mein Junger</i>, when one
smokes for the last time,” he replied.</p>

<p>But the fellow got up, sniffing and walking around
the room.</p>

<p>“It is a most curious tobacco,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Hammersley’s wrists pained him where his bonds
had cut, but he kept his gaze upon the page of the
book, and Senf sat in his chair again. A strong pull
of his arms and Hammersley felt the tension relax.
His bonds came looser and after a few more efforts
his wrists were free. His heart was jumping and he
feared a stray glance of the watcher might see the
throbbing of the blood at his temples, but he clasped
his hands behind him and waited, slipping the sundered
rope beneath a fold of the blanket.</p>

<p>Two—three minutes passed and Senf did not move.
The untying of his feet might prove a difficult matter,
but he made the venture, working slowly and patiently,
his gaze on Senf’s head. Then, as the knot yielded a
little to his prying fingers, his gaze quickly concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
on it. In his efforts he must have made a
sound or a suspicious movement of the shoulders, for
when he looked up he saw the head of Max Senf projecting
above the tailboard of the bed, his large eyes
protruding with amazement. They gazed at each other
for a tense fraction of a second and then sprang upright.
Hammersley threw his feet out upon the floor
and leaped for the man, catching him around the waist
so that he could not draw a weapon. His legs were
useless and the only chance he had, a desperate one at
best, was to drag the man to the floor by sheer weight
and there perhaps throttle him. Senf beat with his
heavy fists on Hammersley’s head and shoulders, and
finally forced him backwards upon the floor, falling
with him, but Hammersley still clung with frantic
grip which the man could not shake off. But at last
he managed to get his fingers around Hammersley’s
throat and tried to force his head back.</p>

<p>Hammersley gasped for breath, but still struggled
gamely, though he realized that he had played his last
card. Things got dark, and dimly he saw the door of
the room open and someone enter. Wentz, of course.
His game was up.</p>

<p>Senf was panting heavily. “He burnt the rope,”
Hammersley heard him say. “Come and help me. He
has a grip of iron.”</p>

<p>The figure from the door moved quickly around the
squirming figures, and Hammersley saw the reflection
of the candle on something bright. A knife. He
heard a blow, and the mass of struggling flesh above
him suddenly collapsed and smothered him with its
weight. With an effort he struggled free and
rolled aside, looking up into the grim face of Lindberg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sh—” the man whispered. “I had to do it.
There was no other way. I’ve been waiting outside.”</p>

<p>Hammersley tried to speak, but his throat closed,
and while he struggled for his breath, he saw Lindberg
go to the door and stand, his ear to the keyhole,
listening. In a moment he came back.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ganz gut!</i> They have heard nothing.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” Hammersley managed to gasp, as
Lindberg cut the rope that bound his ankles.</p>

<p>“Yes. He was so sure of himself that he did not
shout.”</p>

<p>He helped the prisoner to his feet and they clasped
hands.</p>

<p>“Good Lindberg! My friend! I had given up.”</p>

<p>“I have waited until the beer was served. It is well.
And now——” He looked around the room quickly.
“You shall go.”</p>

<p>Hammersley had a sudden thought.</p>

<p>“Captain von Winden sent you?”</p>

<p>“No. He knows nothing. But he has not spoken.
It is now after nine o’clock. By half past nine you
must go.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja doch!</i> But you——!”</p>

<p>“I shall remain.”</p>

<p>“No, no; I will not consent to that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have thought out a plan.”</p>

<p>“But they will suspect. They will shoot you.”</p>

<p>“No, they will not. Have I not told you that I
have thought out a plan?”</p>

<p>“I will listen to it.”</p>

<p>Lindberg meanwhile had been unstrapping his pistol
holster and put it on a chair.</p>

<p>Hammersley glanced over his shoulder at the door.
“But they may come again,” he whispered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think not. There is little time to lose. We will
have to take the chance.”</p>

<p>“But if they return and find me free it will only
cause your death and do me no good.”</p>

<p>“Herr Hammersley, you should know by this time
that I do not waste words. Have I not told you that
I have made a plan? Listen. This is my story for
Herr Hauptmann Wentz. I happen to be in the hallway
without, carrying a pitcher of water to the room
of Miss Mather—the pitcher is outside on the table—when
I hear the sounds of a commotion in this room.
Fearing that the prisoner has by some miracle gotten
free, I unlock the door with my pass-key and enter.
You have burned your bonds and killed Senf. You
spring on me and make me a prisoner——” He
paused.</p>

<p>“And you——” Hammersley broke in. “You will be
left here? No, I won’t leave you—not to that fate.
I will not go unless you go with me. We will contrive
a way to get out of the country.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach, nein!</i> Will you not listen? Have I not told
you that I have thought of everything? I have communicated
with the lady. She is ready to go with
you. Her room has a dormer window around the corner
of the building, and there is a ledge along the roof.
You will go to her. The distance to the roof of the
kitchen is thirty feet. It will require four sheets,
yours and hers. They are new ones and if well twisted
will hold. If you get away safely you can reach the
cave in the Thorwald. No one will ever find you
there——”</p>

<p>“Yes, Lindberg—but you—what will you say to
them?”</p>

<p>“It is no time to waste words. Even now the lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
is waiting for you. Come, you must get ready at
once.”</p>

<p>He walked to the bed and quickly stripped off the
blankets, twisting the sheets and tying them together.
Then he took his pistol belt and fastened it around
Hammersley’s waist, slipping a handful of loose cartridges
into the side pocket of his leather jacket.</p>

<p>Hammersley, bewildered by the devotion of his old
friend and tossed between alternatives of duty, stood
helplessly. At the moment when he needed resolution
most he was supine. But the minutes were passing.
The thought of his mission suddenly brought him to
life, and his face grew hard, his eyes brilliant with
purpose.</p>

<p>“Come, Lindberg. You must go with me.”</p>

<p>“No,” the man insisted. “My plan is the best.”</p>

<p>“No. You must come with me.”</p>

<p>“I have made other plans, Herr Hammersley,” he
whispered gently. “You will go alone. I will give you
a reason.” And before Hammersley could know what
he meant to do, he drew his hunting-knife from its
sheath in Hammersley’s belt and plunged it into his
own shoulder.</p>

<p>Hammersley could scarcely restrain a cry, but Lindberg
smiled at him and plucking the weapon out, put
it in Hammersley’s outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“It is nothing,” he said. “It will bleed a little. The
more it bleeds the better my case with Excellenz.
They will be here in three hours, if not before. Now
bind and gag me—quick. There is no time to lose.”</p>

<p>He lay flat upon the floor and as in a dream Hammersley
obeyed him, tying his arms and legs. When
he had finished, Hammersley bent over the man and
touched his hand gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-by, old friend. Whatever happens I will
not forget. God bless you.”</p>

<p>There was a bright, keen look in the small gray eyes
upturned to his.</p>

<p>That was all Hammersley could see of the swathed
head, but it gave him a new idea of self-sacrifice.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />
<small>SUCCESS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hammersley’s first act was to take off his
shoes and slip one into each pocket of his
jacket. They were soled with rubber, but
even that he feared would make a sound. Then he put
the box of matches in his pocket and blew out the candle,
overturning it on the floor. The shutters of the
window were closed, and if they were opened carefully
the man in the garden below might not notice any
change in the appearance of the window. Hammersley
buttoned his jacket and, carefully pushing back the
shutter, peered out. Fortunately the night had fallen
darkly, and overhead black clouds were lowering, and
while he hesitated, searching the paths below for the
figure of the guard, there was a patter of rain upon
the roof. The gods were propitious.</p>

<p>At last he made out a dark bulk moving to and fro
along the garden path toward the toolhouse. Hammersley
watched, waiting until the man’s back was
turned, when he opened the shutter wider and threw
the rope of sheets out upon the ledge. Closing the
shutter again, he came toward the house. So far so
good, for the whiteness of the sheets would have been
plainly visible had the guard been looking. The next
stage of his escape was more difficult, and he let the
fellow go and come twice along his path as he timed his
new move. He tried the shutter carefully to see that
it did not creak and measured with his eye the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
to the living-room chimney, which he must reach, during
the twenty paces the soldier would take toward
the toolhouse. A wind was blowing in the treetops
and somewhere below him a young oak was rustling
its last year’s leaves. The shutter fortunately opened
in the direction in which he must go, so he sat upon
the window-sill, doubled up, and when the time came,
without looking again at the guard, moved quickly,
slipping out noiselessly, closing the shutter behind him
and, gathering up the sheet as he went, crept like a
cat on a wall along the narrow ledge. It creaked with
his weight, and some small object that his foot had
touched grated along the roof and fell to the ground
below. A tiny sound at best, but magnified in Hammersley’s
ears a hundred times. He had reached the
wide chimney and waited above it, listening for the
footsteps of the man below.</p>

<p>There was no sound. The man had stopped walking.
Hammersley did not dare look out from his hiding-place,
but he knew that in that moment his fate
was hanging in a balance. Just then a heavier gust
of wind than usual dislodged a broken branch from a
tree nearby, which fell to the ground. Still the man
below did not move and Hammersley blessed his wisdom
in closing the shutter, for he knew that the guard
must be peering upward, searching for a sign of anything
unusual in its appearance.</p>

<p>Hammersley held his breath, straining his ears for
the sound that would tell him that he had not failed.
In a while, which seemed interminable, it began again,
the slow crunch of gravel under a heavy foot—ceased,
and began again, as though uncertainly, so he waited
until the sounds were regular as before, then advancing
his head cautiously, he waited for the proper time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and keeping the chimney between himself and the garden,
ran straight up the roof to the gable and
crouched quickly upon the other side. He was more
fortunate this time for the roof gave forth no sound.</p>

<p>Once beyond the protection of the gables he could
for the moment disregard the danger of the guard, for
his orders had been to watch but one window, and
Hammersley knew enough of the German character to
be sure that the soldier below would not leave that
side of the house. As he slid carefully down the roof
upon the other side, he saw that there were two dormers,
and for a moment could not think which of them
let into the room in which Doris was imprisoned. He
reached the ledge and paused. The shutters of both
windows were closed. Lindberg had told him this,
but he swore mildly to himself because he hadn’t paid
closer attention to the Forester’s instructions, for while
one of the rooms was Doris’s, the other he knew was
to be occupied by John Rizzio. It was while he hesitated
that he heard a whisper at his left, and crawling
along the ledge, in a moment had reached the window.</p>

<p>“Is it you, Cyril?” he heard.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he whispered. “Let me in.”</p>

<p>Lindberg had opened the shutter in the afternoon,
but it was still stubborn, and when Cyril put his
strength to Doris’s, it creaked abominably. It was not
really a loud noise, but to the sensitive ears of the
fugitives it seemed as if discovery must be inevitable.
At last they managed to open it wide enough to admit
Cyril’s long legs and his body speedily followed. Inside
the room they stood, their hands clasped, fearful
of discovery, listening for sounds without or within
which would tell them of the approach of the dreaded
Wentz. Nothing but the sighing of the wind in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
treetops and the patter of the rain. As hope returned,
Hammersley questioned quickly:</p>

<p>“You are ready to go?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied eagerly.</p>

<p>“The sheets?”</p>

<p>“Here. I have prepared.”</p>

<p>It was dark and he could not see, but he followed
the sheet to its end with his hand and found that it
was fastened to the bedpost. How she had managed
to move the heavy bed across the room he did not
know, and it was unnecessary to question, for there it
was. He reassured himself as to the knot that she had
made and then fastened his own sheets to the other
end.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can manage it alone? It will
not hold us both.”</p>

<p>“Try me,” she whispered bravely.</p>

<p>“The rope will reach almost to the kitchen roof.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is just below. I could see the edge of it
through the shutter this afternoon.”</p>

<p>He caught her in his arms and their lips met.</p>

<p>“I will go first. Then when the tension relaxes, you
follow.”</p>

<p>She pressed his hand as he slid his feet out of the
window and paused crouching on the ledge listening.
Then he waved his hand and slowly went down. He
knew that the angle of the building quite hid him from
the garden path, and he slid down the improvised rope
as quickly as he could until his feet dangled in space.
He looked below him, but in the darkness the distance
was uncertain. Had Lindberg miscalculated? Or had
Doris used too much of the sheet at the upper end?
He let himself down until his hands groped the end
of the sheet while he felt for a landing with his toes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
He touched nothing, and still swayed and spun in the
air like an apple on a string at All Hallowe’en, a fine
mark for an automatic from any of the windows that
stared blankly at him from the second story. There
was nothing for it but to drop, stretching his toes
down to meet the impact. Fortunately it was not far,
but he lost his balance and toppled sideways, catching
himself upon an arm and knee. Here again the wind
saved him from discovery, but he drew his weapon
and kept a look on the corner of the garden, meanwhile
watching for Doris.</p>

<p>She came at once, slowly but fearlessly, and in a
moment he had her safely in his arms, drawing her
back near the bulk of the building to crouch and wait
and listen again. They did not dare to speak, but
Hammersley’s blood was surging madly with hope.
If they had not been discovered now, the chances were
that some time would elapse, enough at least to enable
the fugitives to get a good start of their pursuers.
But the dangling sheet warned Hammersley
that they must move quickly. He peered over the
edge of the roof. A light was burning in the kitchen,
but whether the room was occupied or not, he could
not tell. He did not dare risk a sprained ankle by
jumping, but found that by lowering himself he could
easily reach the fuel box that stood near the kitchen
door. In a moment they were on the ground and
moving along in the shelter of the hedge toward the
hangar.</p>

<p>Hammersley exulted. It was something to have
brought Doris away, but it was something more to
have circumvented von Stromberg. The bundled figure
of Lindberg, lying up there bleeding in the dark, shot
a pain through his heart, but in action, moving toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the goal of his hopes, even Lindberg was put behind
him. He had no fear for the wound in Lindberg’s
shoulder. The old man was as tough as a pine knot
and would survive the loss of blood. It was Lindberg’s
ordeal with von Stromberg that bothered him.</p>

<p>When they reached the shelter of the woods the tension
relaxed.</p>

<p>“We’re going to get off, Doris,” he said joyously.
“I know every stick of these woods, and they can
never find us. But I’m afraid the strain has been too
much for you. How are you feeling?”</p>

<p>“Never better,” she said bravely. “Which way
now?”</p>

<p>Hammersley had paused a moment to slip on his
shoes, and as he got to his feet,</p>

<p>“Follow me,” he said. “If I go too fast for you,
let me know.”</p>

<p>He cut into the woods and presently struck a path
which led to the left, and for a while they followed
this rapidly. Thanks to a fine physique and a vigorous
life out-of-doors, the girl was in good condition,
and though breathing hard upon the slopes, made no
murmur. Hammersley knew that he had little time to
spare, and Doris followed blindly, asking no questions.
She was aware from what Cyril had said in the afternoon
that his objective in coming to Germany was now
within reach, and she could only judge of its importance
to England by the desperate chances he had
taken. When it was time that she should know he
would tell her. She judged that Cyril knew that she
had been tricked into betraying him, and she made
up her mind that, whatever happened now, she would
stay with him until the end. She owed him that.</p>

<p>After a while, when they had been moving for perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
twenty minutes, they reached an opening in the
trees where she could see gray patches of sky through
the branches overhead, and her feet emerging from
the dry leaves and moss felt a firmer contact.</p>

<p>“The Schöndorf road,” he said. “We can follow
it side by side. Are you tired?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>They went on more rapidly, while Hammersley explained:</p>

<p>“The documents I came to Germany for are to be
brought along this road tonight in an automobile.
The hour they are due to reach Blaufelden is eleven,
and if I know anything of the infallibility of the German
secret messenger, they will be here on time. It
is now after ten. I have an hour or less to make my
preparations.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Get them. First, I’m going to take you to a spot
where you will be as safe as if you were at home in
Ashwater Park.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said firmly, “I’m going with you.”</p>

<p>“But that’s impossible. I don’t know what may
happen. My plans are of the vaguest——”</p>

<p>“I will share them. No, you sha’n’t refuse me. I
will follow you. I can help. I must. I would die
in those roads alone. Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>“But if I fail and they take you, you will be as
guilty as I. It’s an act of war, Doris.”</p>

<p>“Then all the more reason why I should be committed
to it. They made war on me.”</p>

<p>“But there will be danger. I can’t let you take
the risk.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how you are going to stop me,” she
said defiantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused, then stopped and caught her by the
elbows, peering down into her eyes. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>“Mated!” he cried. “This is the greatest moment
of my life.”</p>

<p>“And mine,” her voice answered him.</p>

<p>Her lips met his in a quick caress, like those the
wives of the Spartans gave when they sent their men
to battle.</p>

<p>He caught her hand in his and they moved forward
more quickly. Along this path Death was riding
toward them, but they strode eagerly to meet it, to
defy it, to defeat it. Cyril planned rapidly, casting
anxious glances along the road behind them. Every
foot they traveled took them further from pursuers,
if pursuers there were. Every foot they traveled took
them nearer the advancing messenger. So that the
farther they went the longer would be the while before
they were overtaken, but the shorter the time for preparation
to stop the automobile. Murder was not in
Hammersley’s line. They passed many places, difficult
spots in the road where the machine must almost
stop and go into low gear to climb declivities, places
where projecting rocks jutted rough faces up to the
very ruts of the road. It would not be difficult to
kill with an automatic at a distance of two paces, but
Hammersley could not play the game that way. He
was a spy, if the laws of war called him so, but he
would not, even in this extremity, use the spy’s weapons.
If the other man fought, it would be different.
The desperate nature of the undertaking was beginning
to come to him. Two men, perhaps three or even
four! And yet he must win. He must. Slowly but
surely a plan was forming and he made up his mind
to put it into practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not tired yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. I could go on forever.”</p>

<p>“Then listen. We are nearing the Thorwald. It
is just beyond here, less than half a mile away.”</p>

<p>“The Thorwald?”</p>

<p>“It’s a favorite place of mine, known only to Lindberg
and Udo, a cave high up in the rocks, safe as a
church, unless Udo happens to hunt for us there.”</p>

<p>“And will he?”</p>

<p>“I hope not. At the foot of the crags this road
runs. We must get there first. Can you run?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try.”</p>

<p>He gave her his hand again, and they settled into
a jog trot. She was breathing fast in a moment, but
she was game and did not falter, though her lungs
seemed to be bursting. But as they neared the spot,
Cyril slowed down to a walk again.</p>

<p>“At the foot of the glen there’s a dry bed of a
stream full of rocks. There used to be a bridge here,
but it was washed away. It’s an awkward spot, even
for a good motor. I’m going to make it worse.”</p>

<p>He left her, dashing on ahead, while she followed,
and when she reached the stream she saw him dragging
one of the bridge timbers across the road. She
wanted to help, but he told her to watch, until he got
another and then another timber into place. And in
another moment it was evident that the barricade was
formidable enough to deter any machine from crossing.
And there was no way to go around, for upon
one side rose the crags and upon the other the gully
fell away into a dark pit filled with rocks and tangled
branches.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it now but to wait. And
yet it seemed a desperate thing to do. Weary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
blown as Doris was, it would have seemed better to
have gone on and on—anything to put distance between
Cyril and the death that surely awaited them
back there. It seemed impossible that so long a time
as this could have elapsed before the tell-tale rope
of sheets should have been discovered. Already she
was sure that Wentz and his men must be on the
way in a machine or on horses, perhaps which would
cover the distance they had traveled in less than a
quarter of the time. She thought that she heard the
sound of a machine in the distance and the voices of
men. She pleaded with him to go on, but he only
smiled at her.</p>

<p>“You must do what I say, Doris,” he said, and then
paused, listening. “They’re coming,” he whispered.</p>

<p>She <em>had</em> heard the sound of a machine. “From
which direction?” she gasped.</p>

<p>“There,” and he pointed across the gully.</p>

<p>“They’ll be here in a moment. Listen to me! Walk
quickly to your right, across the road to that large
stone. Stop!” She obeyed wonderingly. “Now cross
the road again, using those rocks as stepping stones.”
She did it, bewildered, pausing on a ledge of rocks
that formed a part of the crag. “Now follow the line
of the rocks into the bushes. Fifty feet from the
road, hidden among the shrubbery, you’ll find a cleft
in the rocks. Climb it and you’ll come out here,” and
he pointed upward just above the road. “Wait for
me there. I’ll come in a moment.”</p>

<p>And as she hesitated, he caught her by the elbows
and shoved her along the ledge backwards. “Go! Do
you hear? I’ll have no refusal.”</p>

<p>There was no denying the accent of command in his
voice or the quick flash of his eye. Never until von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
Stromberg had badgered her today had a man spoken
to her in this tone before. But she loved him for it,
rejoiced in his strength—the primitive instinct of
woman to obey.</p>

<p>When she had gone, Hammersley quickly crossed
the stream and took a position behind a thick bush,
listening to the exhaust of the approaching machine,
but listening and looking, too, in the opposite direction
for sounds of his pursuers. A searchlight made fantastic
shapes among the leaves and long shadows suddenly
shot out along the road.</p>

<p>Hammersley had drawn his automatic from his
pocket and was fingering it coolly. He put his fingers
over his eyes, so that the light would not mar
his familiarity with the darkness. He did not know
how many men opposed him and did not seem to care.
The main thing now was to keep his eye undimmed and
his hand steady. The machine came, slowed down and
stopped while a guttural exclamation came from the
driver. The searchlight focused downward into the
rocks of the gully. Screening his eyes from its light
with a hand, Hammersley peered out at the occupants
of the car. There were two men—better than three,
but not so good as one. The man at the wheel rose
and got down just beside him, moving forward to remove
the obstacles.</p>

<p>Hammersley wasted no time. He leveled his automatic
at the broad back of the driver and his voice
rang sharply in German:</p>

<p>“I have come here for the dispatches intended for
Herr General von Stromberg. You will give them to
me at once.”</p>

<p>The man who was just bending over toward the timber
straightened quickly and turned, reaching for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
holster, but the man in the seat of the car, who wore
a military cap, was quicker, for there was a report,
and a bullet sang close to Hammersley’s ear.</p>

<p>A stream of fire came from Hammersley’s automatic;
three shots in quick succession, and the man in
the car pitched forward in his seat and slid to the
floor. And by the time the other man had drawn his
pistol, Hammersley had leaped behind a tree and came
out of some bushes beyond. The chauffeur fired, but
not in Hammersley’s direction. The continuous glare
of the light in their eyes had made their vision in the
darkness uncertain.</p>

<p>“Do you surrender?” shouted Hammersley.</p>

<p>The German’s reply was to fire at him again and
miss. He still stood in the reflection of the headlight,
a bulky silhouette, which made too fair a mark, while
Hammersley stood in the shadows of the bushes.
Hammersley pitied him.</p>

<p>“Surrender!” he repeated.</p>

<p>The man was not a coward and rushed blindly
toward the voice, shooting again, too close for comfort.</p>

<p>“Well, then——” Hammersley said, and fired again.</p>

<p>The man stumbled to his knees and then fell prone,
his fingers clutching among the leaves. The whole incident
had taken less than a minute, and a deathly
silence seemed to fall, following the reverberations of
the shots. Hammersley stood tensely, listening and
peering along the road toward Blaufelden. There was
a glow of light at a distance and he could now hear
the sound of another machine. Von Stromberg had
learned of his escape and with a perfect intuition was
coming here directly and fast. The sound of the shots
had been heard. There was no time to lose. Hammersley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
bent over the man on the ground and searched
his pockets rapidly. Gloves, matches, a spark plug,
tobacco, but no papers. The chauffeur, of course.
By main strength he lifted the dead weight of the
man in the car and carried him down into the glare of
the searchlight. It was a dangerous thing to do, for
the lights of the machine from Blaufelden were already
swinging through the treetrunks. But he worked
quickly and skillfully, tearing open the officer’s gray
overcoat and searching his pockets. In the inside
pocket of his uniform he found them, a bulky package,
and other papers. He read the superscription
quickly, “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sein Excellenz General Graf von Stromberg</i>.”
Then sprang aside out of the glare of the lights at
the very moment when the other machine came swinging
rapidly around the turn in the road.</p>

<p>“The papers are safe?” roared a voice which Hammersley
recognized.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</i>,” Hammersley replied in a rough tone. “A
man tried to stop me and I shot him.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ganz gut!</i>”</p>

<p>“He is here,” shouted Hammersley again.</p>

<p>All the while he had been moving out of the glare
of the searchlights, and as the men from the other car
tumbled out and came forward, he turned into the
darkness, and abandoning all caution, took to his heels
and ran at top speed in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Behind him he heard shouts as his trick was discovered,
but he knew that in the matter of speed he had
nothing to fear afoot from any German at Windenberg.
The thing that bothered him now was a way to
hide the marks of his footsteps, for in places the
mud was soft and he knew that in the morning
light they would follow him; so he picked his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
carefully, running at top speed for a mile at least, to
lead the pursuit away from the Thorwald and then
at the banks of a small stream paused a moment and
listened. He had eluded them. Then without hesitation,
though puffing fearfully from his exertions, he
stepped down into the cold waters of the stream and
waded up it, avoiding the ledges and making sure
that he left no mark behind him. As he climbed
higher up the mountain, he could see in the distance
the glow of the lights of the machines and when he
reached a mossy bank which would not betray him,
he clambered out of the water and turned, doubling
like a fox, upon his trail, turning back in the general
direction from which he had come.</p>

<p>Doris worried him. He could imagine her crouching
there two hundred feet in the air just above the two
machines, half dead with fear of capture and terror
for him. Had she seen what had happened and understood
it? Would she have the kind of silent endurance
to crouch there and wait? He hurried on
into the maze of rocks and deep woods, finding at last a
deer trail that he knew. There were but two means
of ingress to the cave of the Thorwald, one by the
secret path in the bushes up the rocks which Doris
had taken, the other from the upper side which he
was now rapidly approaching.</p>

<p>He ran along the deer trail, reloading his automatic
as he went, his eyes peering ahead for familiar
landmarks, cutting in at last to the left at a
great rock around which the deer trail led. He now
proceeded with great caution. Far below him he could
see the reflections of the lights of the two cars and
heard the voices of men. He went down a way toward
the wall of rocks, clambering over huge bowlders, hauling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
himself here and there by the aid of tree limbs,
reaching at last the dry bed of the old stream which
down in the road had been of such assistance to him.</p>

<p>Now the wall of rock rose sheer before him. He
stole cautiously along its face, feeling with his hands
and peering upward. In a moment he found what he
was looking for, a small projecting ledge which he
mounted, and followed to his right for a way, then
mounting again by easy stages to a fissure wider than
his body which he entered and followed quickly. It
led downward it seemed into the bowels of the crag,
but came out suddenly into an open space, a kind of
amphitheater, with a ridge of rock upon one side, and
upon the other what appeared to be a solid wall. He
crossed this space quickly and peered over.</p>

<p>Below him the crag jutted out over the road and
upon it somewhere was Doris. He strained his gaze
downward but could not see her. What if they had
found her footsteps and followed? No, that was
hardly possible, for the ridge of rock began immediately
at the road, and thanks to his precautions, she
would leave no footprints.</p>

<p>Slowly he descended, choosing his footing with quick
deliberation, for the slightest sound, the dislodging
of a twig or a sliver of crumbled stone and the crag of
the Thorwald would become in a moment a hornet’s
nest. Fortunately the back of the rock screened him
from the road, and unless von Stromberg had sent men
into the woods to left and right, there was no chance
of discovery. At last he reached the level and a dark
shadow rose at his very feet and silently clasped his
hand. He took her in his arms for a moment in devout
thankfulness. If the true moment of their mating
had been back there in the road while danger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
threatened them before and behind, this place of security
was the beginning of its consummation. He did
not speak and only motioned her to sit while he
crouched beside her, waiting.</p>

<p>Below in the road he heard the rasping voice of
His Excellenz, speaking in no gentle tones to the
wounded chauffeur of the messenger’s machine, asking
question after question which were answered feebly
enough. After a while the men who had followed
Hammersley returned and made their reports—the
dull boom of the voice of Wentz and the harsh crackle
of von Stromberg’s in rage and mortification.</p>

<p>“He got away, Excellenz,” said Wentz. “For a
moment only I saw him, and followed fast as I could,
but my legs are too short.”</p>

<p>“Bah! You are an imbecile, Herr Hauptmann.
And the other men, are not their legs longer?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Herr Hammersley has the legs of a deer.
They are following, but it is like hunting for a grain
of barley in a coal scuttle. He may have taken to
the woods anywhere.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</i>—but the Fräulein. She could not have run as
fast as he!”</p>

<p>“It is my opinion,” said Wentz with some temerity,
“that they had a <em>rendezvous</em> somewhere beyond. He
has known these mountains since his boyhood.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Esel!</i> But she hasn’t, and how should she find it
in the dark?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, the matter being so important, he would
have deserted her.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Quatsch!</i> Find me the girl and I will find you
Hammersley.”</p>

<p>Hammersley felt Doris’s clasp tighten on his own.</p>

<p>“She cannot have gotten far away. Search for her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">schafskopf</i>. Search the woods and rocks until morning.
Take the other machine and follow his footsteps
until you see them no more. Then follow his trail
in the woods. Take the two <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Försters</i> with you. I will
go back to Blaufelden to send for more men and question
the guards who permitted his escape. Go!”</p>

<p>The fugitives sat silently listening to the sounds
below them, heard the orders to put the wounded
man and the dead messenger into the machine and
presently the commotion of departure as the machines
were backed away from the gully, turned, in available
spots, and then departed in opposite directions, General
von Stromberg’s at full speed, the other slowly,
while Captain Wentz walked on before, his shoulders
bent, trying to follow the signs of Hammersley’s rubber
soles in the road. But it had begun to rain steadily
again and Hammersley was thankful, for it would
not be long before all marks of his footsteps would be
erased.</p>

<p class="cap">“Safe?” he heard her whisper.</p>

<p>“Yes, for the present.”</p>

<p>“You have what you came for?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“And what shall we do now?”</p>

<p>“Sleep. You’re dead beat. Come.”</p>

<p>He rose and helped her to her feet, then after another
pause, turned toward the wall of rocks behind
them.</p>

<p>“Do you think you can make it? It’s a difficult
climb.”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ve that much left in me. You lead the
way and I’ll follow.” Her teeth were chattering.</p>

<p>As he touched her sleeve he found it soaked with
moisture.</p>

<p>“Poor child. You’re nearly frozen.” He had not
been conscious of the occasional spatter of rain,
for his leather jacket had kept him dry. “But
I’ll have you warm and snug before you can say
knife.”</p>

<p>And when she questioned, “A fire——” he replied,
“Isn’t that what one uses to get warm with?”</p>

<p>“But here—tonight——?”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t bother. You’ll see.”</p>

<p>They were climbing up the face of the slippery
rocks, Hammersley pausing from time to time to let
her rest, pulling her from above when he reached the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
ledges, and at last they came out into the amphitheater
of bowlders from which he had descended.</p>

<p>She was almost too weary for comment and followed
blindly as he led her to the wall of the rock where he
seemed to disappear in its very face. She followed
him inside a dark opening and when they were well
within he relinquished her hand and struck a match.
A brief glimpse she had of a small chamber in the cliff
not twenty feet square when the match went out. He
struck another and shading it with his hand went forward.
She saw him find what he was looking for and in
a moment a candle, after faintly sputtering for a moment,
sent forth a steady glow of light.</p>

<p>“Sit here on this stool. I’ll have you right in a
jiffy.”</p>

<p>She obeyed him and looked around her. At one side
was a bed of pine needles, at another a small table and
in the middle of the rocky floor the gray embers of
what had been a fire.</p>

<p>“A bit roughish, but not so bad?”</p>

<p>She nodded while he busied himself in building the
fire. There were dry leaves, twigs and logs in the
corner, and soon a blaze was leaping cheerfully upward.
And while she wondered at the signs of occupancy
he answered her thought.</p>

<p>“It’s Lindberg’s. He comes here often. It was
here that he and I always slept when we went on hunting
trips. You see there’s a natural chimney overhead
in the rocks where the bally smoke goes out.
They might observe the smoke by day, but at night
we’re quite safe. I’ve been all around the place when
the fire was goin’ and there isn’t a sign of it outside.”</p>

<p>He helped her put her coat off and made her comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
close to the fire, after which he quickly took
the package of papers out of his pocket and examined
them. The single papers were military orders of no
importance to one Lieutenant Orstmann, obviously the
dead messenger. Hammersley put them aside, breaking
the seal of the heavy envelope and examining its
contents carefully. First a letter of instructions to
His Excellency von Stromberg, signed in the bold hand
of the Emperor of Germany himself. He showed her
the signature and explained its contents and all
thought of weariness went from her mind.</p>

<p>“It is—it’s what you came for?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied, smiling grimly. “I’ve got it.”</p>

<p>“Is it—it isn’t so important that you can’t tell
me?” she asked timidly.</p>

<p>He laughed, put his arm around her and held her
for a moment tenderly. She had endured where a man
might have flinched, and yet at this moment she was
all woman—timid, weary unto death, but still curious.
It was the master impulse.</p>

<p>“No,” he smiled. “You’ve jolly well earned the right
to know. I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>He was so big, so strong, so certain of himself that
she wondered how, for a moment even, she could have
thought him other than he was. With a sudden impulse
of pride and tenderness, she rose, put her arms
around his neck and bending his head down to hers
kissed him upon the lips. He caught her to him and
held her in his arms.</p>

<p>“O Cyril,” she murmured, “that I could ever have
failed in my belief in you, that I could ever have
thought that you were false! Why didn’t you tell me
the truth? I would have kept your secret.”</p>

<p>“It was impossible, dear. It was too big a thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and I was sworn to silence. But since you found
out——”</p>

<p>“Did you think me curious—” she asked naïvely,
“because I read the cigarette papers?”</p>

<p>“Curious!” he laughed. “Well rather! The mistake
I made was in tellin’ you <em>not</em> to read them. If
I——”</p>

<p>“Don’t laugh at me,” she whispered. “I can’t stand
that. The only retribution for what I did this afternoon
is a blow. If you struck me, Cyril, I should not
care.”</p>

<p>“But I won’t, you know, old girl. But I’m going to
kiss you again if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>And he did, while a shadow darkened her eyes. “It
seems terrible to be happy, even in our moment of
security, with the shadow of death hanging so closely
over us. I know you had to kill him, Cyril, but——”
She paused.</p>

<p>“It was either that or he would have killed <em>me</em>. As
it was, it was too jolly close a thing for comfort. I
gave the other man his chance, but he wouldn’t take it.
Lucky he didn’t, for I might have missed the papers.”</p>

<p>She clung to him more closely.</p>

<p>“And if you had been killed?” she whispered. “I
saw it all. At first I thought you had fallen. O
Cyril, the agony of it! And then you came out from
behind the tree and I knew that you were unharmed.
I had seen a man die, as I had, there upon the rocks
at Ben-a-Chielt, but when the other one came at you
I wanted you to kill him. I <em>wanted</em> it. I prayed that
you would. It was murder—in my heart. I can’t
understand how I have changed. And I’ve always
thought death such a fearsome thing!”</p>

<p>She hid her face in his shoulder and clung to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
trembling. She had passed through danger valiantly,
carelessly even, but now that for the moment danger
had passed, woman-like, she yielded to the reaction.
He kissed her gently.</p>

<p>“Sh—child. Don’t let it work on you. No bally
use. We’re safe now.”</p>

<p>“Yes—safe for the present. That ought to be
enough for me. But if anything had happened to
you—!” She shuddered.</p>

<p>“But it didn’t——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m thankful,” she whispered. “Thankful for
that—and for you—the trouble I’ve passed through—the
pain of my thoughts of you—I’m thankful for
those too, because without them I never should have
known you—the real <em>you</em>, Cyril. I sometimes think
that life deals too easily with most of us to bring out
the best that’s in us. I never would have known you
in England, Cyril, doing the things you always did.”</p>

<p>He smiled at her.</p>

<p>“I’m the same chap, though. Can’t tell what a fellow
will do when he has to.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t have to. You might have gone to
France and sat in a trench. Instead of that you did
what was harder—let them distrust you—hold you in
contempt—keeping silent and cheerful, while you were
doing such splendid things for England.” She paused
while she caressed him and said in a proud whisper,
“The Honorable Cyril!”</p>

<p>“Honorable!” he smiled. “You’d hardly get von
Stromberg to think that.”</p>

<p>“That terrible old man!” she went on clinging to
him. “I can see his vulture face now. He would have
shot you—tomorrow!”</p>

<p>“But we fooled him—what? Poor Lindberg!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>She questioned him and he told her of the devotion
of his old friend.</p>

<p>“And what will von Stromberg do to Lindberg?”
she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said slowly. “Nothin’ perhaps,
unless Udo tells.” He paused and looked into the fire.
“Wish I knew about Udo,” he said thoughtfully.
“We were very good pals last year.”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t see you shot!”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t do anythin’. I am betrayin’ his country.”</p>

<p>“But not <em>your</em> country, Cyril,” she said.</p>

<p>“No, thank God. Not mine. I love Germany—the
Germany of my mother—and the men like Lindberg.
But the Germany of von Stromberg—that’s not Germany
to me.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we will get away?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said quickly.</p>

<p>She read the anxiety in his voice and knew that he
was thinking of her, and in that moment a new idea of
her duty came to her.</p>

<p>“You mean,” she said quickly, “that you could get
away if it wasn’t for me. O Cyril, I know. Don’t try
to deceive me. You could disguise yourself and get
away to the Swiss border. It would not be difficult
for you. I am a weight around your neck which may
destroy you.”</p>

<p>“Hush, child.”</p>

<p>“No. I am not too stupid to see that. You ought
to be going now.” She clung to his arms and looked
up into his face as her duty came more clearly to her,
while her voice trembled with earnestness. “I want
you to go, Cyril. Your life is valuable to England.
They are on a false scent down there. You could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
away in the darkness and by morning you can be miles
away. I’m not afraid. Tomorrow I can go and give
myself up. I am only a girl—an American. They
will not dare to harm me. Don’t smile. I am in deadly
earnest. You must go, Cyril—now—now——”</p>

<p>But he only patted her gently.</p>

<p>“You think that I am a child,” she went on, “that
I cannot be trusted to get along alone. Haven’t I
proved it to you that I am not afraid? Look at me,
Cyril. I am only a little tired now but tomorrow
I will go to von Stromberg and say, ‘Here I am—now
what can you do to me?’ He may threaten and bluster
and rage, but that will not frighten me—when you are
safe. What can he reply? What <em>could</em> he do? My
nation is not at war with his. He would not <em>dare</em>! O
Cyril, say that you’ll go—say that you’ll go——”</p>

<p>She looked up into his face and saw that its expression
had not changed. He was still smiling at her
softly while she felt the touch of his fingers gently
petting her.</p>

<p>“Oh—you won’t go—you won’t!” she cried, and then
without further warning burst into a passion of tears.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Doris, for God’s sake,” he whispered. “Don’t
break now. I need all your courage and your strength.
You’ve been so brave—so strong. Keep up your
spirits, there’s a dear. We’ll pull through, don’t you
worry.”</p>

<p>“They’ll take you—if you stay here.”</p>

<p>“No. They won’t find us. I’m not afraid of that,
and there are water and biscuits here. We’ll take
things easy for a while and then slip off. Do you
think I could go and leave you in the lurch? Pretty
sort of a Johnny I’d be to do a thing like that! Not
for twenty Englands, Doris,” he whispered, kissing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
her tenderly. “Not for twenty Englands, I wouldn’t.”
His touch soothed her and she grew more quiet.</p>

<p>“Of—of course you w-wouldn’t,” she murmured.
“But I w-wish you would.”</p>

<p>Her hands met around his neck and he raised her
chin and kissed her on the mouth. It was a kiss of
plighted troth, of tenderness, faith and the exalted
passion that comes with tears.</p>

<p>“Mated?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” she murmured faintly.</p>

<p>They did not move for a long moment when Doris
slowly disengaged her arms from around his neck
and moved slightly away. Her hair had fallen and
hung in golden disorder about her shoulders. She put
up her arm, trying to catch the escaping pins, and
then she smiled at him, dimpling adorably.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said gently. “You must get to bed.
Your coat is nearly dry, but I’ll cover you with my
jacket. You must sleep, too. No shammin’, you know.
Can’t tell what may happen tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” she murmured obediently, while he led her
to the couch of boughs and made her lie on it. But
as he knelt beside her, covering her with his jacket,
she caught his hands and would not relinquish them.
He raised hers to his lips and kissed them again and
again: small, muscular hands they were, but now very
brown and dirty. “Are you comfortable? Sorry I
haven’t a tub.”</p>

<p>She was silent a moment and then straightened and
asked him:</p>

<p>“You promised to tell me about the papers. Won’t
you?”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“Not now. It must be nearly morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, now. I’m not tired now. I will sleep afterwards.
I like to hear your voice, Cyril. Perhaps it
will soothe me to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” he asked doubtfully—and she
nodded.</p>

<p>He saw that she was still nervous and wakeful and
sank beside her couch, taking her hand in his.</p>

<p>“It is really quite interestin’,” he began slowly.
“Three years ago, at the invitation of the Emperor of
Germany, when Europe was at peace and there was no
cloud upon the horizon bigger than a chap’s hand,
there met in a shootin’ lodge near Schöndorf, not ten
miles from here, six men. It was a secret conference,
arranged by the Emperor of Germany through His
Excellency Graf von Stromberg. The six men were
His Highness Prince von Waldheim, at one time Germany’s
ambassador to France; Admiral von Frankenhausen,
head and front of the Imperial German Navy;
General von Sandersdorf, the brains of the German
General Staff; His Excellency Moritz von Komarom,
minister of war of the Austrian Empire; Viscount
Melborne, English Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs; and Harlow-Gorden, of the British Admiralty.”</p>

<p>She was listening avidly, wide-eyed, the array of
well-known names telling her as nothing else could
have done the importance of the conference.</p>

<p>“This meetin’ was a secret,” he went on. “These
men all traveled incognito, without servants, and were
met by an agent of General von Stromberg at Schöndorf
and conducted in automobiles to the huntin’ lodge
I have spoken of. These men remained there for two
days and two nights and then went home. But while
they were there they were makin’ new history for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Europe.” He paused to fill his pipe but her curiosity
could not be restrained.</p>

<p>“And what were they doing there, Cyril? I can’t
understand.”</p>

<p>Hammersley got up and held his pipe to the candle,
for matches were scarce, and then, with maddening
calmness, sat beside her again.</p>

<p>“That secret meetin’ of these chaps had to do with
nothin’ less than the ruin of France——”</p>

<p>“France!” she cried. “England had nothing
against France and now she is her ally.”</p>

<p>“Three years ago the political conditions were different,”
he answered. “Those representatives of England
came and sat with representatives of Germany
and Austria while they plotted the destruction of
France.”</p>

<p>“But how do you know this, Cyril? I can’t understand.”</p>

<p>“No more do I, but it’s a fact. Let me go on. At
the table in the lodge where this conference was held,
Viscount Melborne made notes of what was goin’ on,
includin’ the combinations of land and naval forces
that could be made against France and Russia, and
the plans to break the Russian Federation in the Balkans.
When the meetin’ was over all the scraps of
paper these chaps had scribbled on were destroyed by
fire before the eyes of the men who had made ’em,
except those of Viscount Melborne, who put ’em in
his pocket, and with them a pencil copy of this secret
treaty in his own handwriting. The original copy of
the treaty was entrusted to Harlow-Gorden, who put
it in his dispatch-box. It was not until the next day
when the Englishmen, in the train on the way to Paris,
discovered that Viscount Melborne’s private papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
were missin’. Jolly fine mess—what? They got off at
the next stop, went back to Schöndorf and looked for
the papers, but neither there nor at the lodge was
there hair or hide of ’em. So they went back to England
hopin’ that by some fortunate accident the papers
had been destroyed.”</p>

<p>“And these—” asked the girl, “are they?”</p>

<p>He nodded. “To make the story short, I found out
where they had gone. My flights to Germany have
been made for this purpose. Don’t you see? The
papers came into the hands of the Emperor of Germany
and he was plannin’ to have ’em sent to the
President of the French Republic—England’s ally. It
wouldn’t do, you know, to have such papers at such a
time fall into the hands of France. Hardly a credit
to English diplomacy. What? Might even result in
a new <em>entente</em>.”</p>

<p>“But where were the papers in the meanwhile?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“That is what took me so bally long to find out.
After many hunts away from Windenberg at night, I
traced ’em to a Socialist by the name of Gottschalk
at Schöndorf, who had received ’em from a pensioner
of the Imperial Forest Service, one of the attendants
at the huntin’ lodge where the conference was held.
Whether he found ’em or stole ’em I don’t know, but
I frightened him and he confessed. I was on the very
point of stealing ’em from Gottschalk when I found
out that he had been writin’ to the Wilhelmstrasse, and
when I tried to get ’em they were gone. If I’d got ’em
then, you would not be here, Doris, and I——”</p>

<p>“But how did you learn what the Wilhelmstrasse
proposed to do with them?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was quite clear. The English Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Office has been badly frightened and has used every
effort with its secret agents in Berlin to get that
information. It reached London the other day. And
just before I left Scotland I knew the job was to be
given to General von Stromberg. The rest was Kismet—the
fortune of war—a jolly good piece of luck!
Lindberg overheard through the microphone von
Stromberg givin’ instructions to Wentz—so that His
Excellency’s own weapons were turned against him.
I was goin’ to waylay Wentz on the way to France,
but circumstances prevented——”</p>

<p>“It was I, Cyril,” she broke in pleadingly. “I didn’t
know. I betrayed you.”</p>

<p>“A trick,” he laughed, “invented in the Rameses
family—but still useful.”</p>

<p>“He frightened me,” she stammered. “I believed
the message signed ‘Maxwell’ genuine.”</p>

<p>“Not Maxwell,” he said gravely, “for Maxwell—a
sore spot since the war began in the side of the War
Office—Maxwell is dead.”</p>

<p>“You——?” she exclaimed fearfully.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied. “I told and they caught him. I
couldn’t do so before. It’s war, Doris. It is a fair
game. I ask no favors—nor do I give any.”</p>

<p>She was silent a moment looking into the fire.</p>

<p>“Yes, I understand—a terrible game with odds
against——” And then, after a pause, “You say that
we will get away. Won’t you tell me your plan?”</p>

<p>He rose with a confident laugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, I have a plan, but I’m not going to tell it now.
You are going to sleep.”</p>

<p>She laughed wearily and sat up.</p>

<p>“And you? Where will you sleep?”</p>

<p>“By the fire. I’ve got some thinkin’ to do. I’m not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
sleepy. I had eight hours last night. I’m going to
watch.”</p>

<p>He bent over her and gently made her lie down.
“I will talk to you no more. You must go to sleep.”</p>

<p>She sighed and stretched herself out while he covered
her with his coat. Then he put a fresh log on
the fire and sat beside her again. In a moment he
heard her voice.</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t mind my telling you, Cyril, that
I love you a great deal.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least,” he whispered. “I wouldn’t mind
listenin’ while you said it all night. But——”</p>

<p>“There. You’re going to insist on my sleeping
again!”</p>

<p>“Won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t seem to feel as if I could ever sleep again.
You’re so cool, so calm, Cyril. How <em>can</em> you be?”</p>

<p>“No bally use gettin’ excited. Here we are snug as
two bugs in a rug. We’ll slip through them some
way.”</p>

<p>“But where will we go?”</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>“I have a notion of goin’ to England.” His kind
of quiet humor always put her on her mettle.</p>

<p>“To England—?” She started up.</p>

<p>“There won’t be much chance of your doin’ anythin’
tomorrow if you don’t get your sleep,” he insisted
gently. “Do what I ask, Doris. Sleep you
must.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try. Good night, Cyril.”</p>

<p>“Good night.” He kissed her on the forehead and
drew his jacket over her again, then sat beside her,
her hand in his, watching. Gradually her nerves grew
quiet and weariness mastered her. He waited until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
her breathing indicated sleep, when he carefully relinquished
her hand and moved to the fire, where he carefully
studied the papers by the light of his candle,
after which he slipped them into the pocket of his
trousers and moved softly across the cave into a corner,
where he opened the lid of a tin box and examined
its contents, taking out a fresh candle to replace the
other one, which was on the point of expiring.</p>

<p>Then he filled his pipe with great deliberateness and,
returning to the stool by the fire, crossed his knees and
bent forward, gazing into the blaze, his brows tangled
in deep thought. He had succeeded in getting what
he came for. So far, the secret of the meeting in the
shooting lodge was safe. But for how long? By this
time a description of the two of them had, of course,
been telegraphed to every village and military station
in Germany. That wouldn’t do at all. Alone it might
be managed, with a German officer’s uniform and Herr
Lieutenant Orstmann’s military orders, but with Doris—it
wasn’t to be thought of.</p>

<p>The other alternative appealed to him more
strongly. He had matched his wits against von Stromberg’s
so far and had won, and success made him hopeful.
Where carefulness failed, audacity sometimes
succeeded. The more he thought of his plan, the
deeper became his conviction that it was the only one
possible under the circumstances. There was continued
danger for the papers and he deliberated for a
long while upon the wisdom of destroying them at
once, finally rejecting that idea except as a last alternative.
His word that he had destroyed them would
perhaps be sufficient to ease the minds of the gentlemen
at the Foreign Office, but there were certain memoranda
about the promises of Germany to England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
signed with the initials of Prince von Waldheim which
should at all costs be saved. But aside from this
consideration, Hammersley, having carried his affairs
thus far successfully, had a pride in finishing it as he
had planned. It could be done—he would do it.</p>

<p>He got up and put another log on the fire and
then stretched himself out at full length upon the
rocks, gazing into the flame. In the corner where the
bed was he heard the steady breathing of the girl.
What a trump she was— What a tr——</p>

<p>He nodded and then dozed. Troubled visions flitted
across his mind. Once he thought he heard the sound
of a footstep on the rocks and started up. It was
broad daylight. He listened for a while and then
slowly sank back and slept again. How long he did
not know, for something awakened him and he sat up,
reaching instinctively for the holster lying at his side,
to look straight into the muzzle of an automatic, behind
which was the handsome blond head of Udo von
Winden.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>THE FIGHT IN THE CAVERN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Udo loomed against the light and the uniform he
wore seemed to give the projecting weapon
a new significance. He was not Udo, the
kinsman and companion who had so often shared this
refuge with Hammersley in the hunting days. He
was Germany. Hammersley could never remember the
time when the muzzle of a weapon had seemed so large.
It was much better to sit without moving, and Udo’s
quick instructions were not wasted.</p>

<p>“Don’t move, Cyril,” he said coolly in German. “Up
with your hands! So. Now get up, leaving your belt
where it is, and sit on the stool yonder. Quickly! I
will shoot—to kill.”</p>

<p>Hammersley read in his expression a determination
to put the threat into practice and, watching narrowly,
silently obeyed. Von Winden, still covering
him carefully, picked up the belt and transferred
Lindberg’s pistol to his own holster. He was a dead
shot with any firearm, as Hammersley knew, and his
own chances at three paces even in a rush were small.
It was decidedly a case for discretion.</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s nothing to be said,” Hammersley
muttered. “You outguessed me, Udo.” And then, to
gain a moment of time, “I thought that your memory
might be quite good enough to forget the Thorwald.”
Von Winden frowned down the barrel of the automatic.</p>

<p>“It is too much to expect even from me,” he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
crisply. “I am your kinsman but I am first of all—a
German. And not even for you will I be a traitor.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Natürlich!</i>” smiled Cyril.</p>

<p>Udo von Winden’s look was grave, his voice sober,
and the muzzle of his automatic did not waver.</p>

<p>“I have already had a bad memory, my cousin.
This afternoon I forgot that Lindberg, who served
your meals, was a good friend of yours and mine and
that he might be counted on to help you out of your
difficulties. I also forgot that there was such a place
as the Cave of the Thorwald until I learned from Excellenz
last night, the price Germany was to pay for
my indifference. If you had failed to capture the
documents of His Majesty, I might have remained
silent. As you took them, there remained nothing but
to act. I came here, for I knew it would be the one
place where I should find you.” Hammersley bent his
head. “I understand.” And then quickly, “Would
you mind telling me if you have spoken—if you have
told what Lindberg—?”</p>

<p>“No,” von Winden broke in, “I have told nothing.
Lindberg is safe. I have come here alone——”</p>

<p>Hammersley gave a gasp of relief and leaned forward,
peering into the fire.</p>

<p>“I came for one purpose, Cyril,” Udo went on
quietly. “I have no personal desire for your death,
but I would kill you as you sit rather than see Germany
suffer the loss of the documents in your possession.
I came for them and I intend that you shall
give them to me.”</p>

<p>Hammersley looked up into his cousin’s face and
their eyes met. Von Winden’s tone was cool and his
manner as calm as on the days last year when they
were hunting together, but Hammersley knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
when Udo von Winden was most calm he was also most
dangerous. So he slowly reached into the pocket of
his trousers and handed his cousin the papers he had
taken from the German messenger.</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Danke</i>,” said Udo, backing to the light of the entrance
of the cave to examine them. “You are sure
they are all here?”</p>

<p>“My word on it, Udo,” said Hammersley frankly.
He watched his cousin examine the documents and
heard him give an exclamation of satisfaction, but
Hammersley saw that his eyes neglected no detail of
the cavern and was aware that the muzzle of the
weapon in Udo’s hand still bore directly upon him.
In the shadows Hammersley saw the face of Doris,
who was sitting up, pallid and dark-eyed as though
awakened from one nightmare into another. As Udo
saw her the muzzle of his weapon wavered and went
out of alignment, but Hammersley did not move or
even appear to notice the girl.</p>

<p>There was a note of embarrassment in the German’s
officer’s voice as he spoke again.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, my cousin, that your father’s blood
called you to be false to Germany. You had been suspected
by Excellenz, but I would have sworn that he
was mistaken. You owe me nothing, of course,
but——”</p>

<p>“It’s war, Udo,” said Hammersley quietly. “You
will remember that I did not seek duty in the Imperial
Secret Service. It was the Herr General who thought
it valuable to use our kinship for his own purposes.”</p>

<p>Udo shrugged. “Yes, I know,” he said quietly.
“You have done your duty—but you must now be
aware of the fact that you can ask no favors of
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t. I am in your power. Shoot me if you
like.”</p>

<p>Udo smiled.</p>

<p>“I can hardly be expected to do that. I do not love
you now, my cousin. I cannot love anyone who is false
to my country, but I cannot forget that once, not a
year ago, we were brothers. No, I cannot shoot you,
Cyril, though perhaps that would be a better death
than that other—yonder.”</p>

<p>Hammersley shrugged. “It is the fortune of war.
From your point of view I deserve it. I can only thank
you again, for myself and for Miss Mather, for your
generosity.”</p>

<p>A sound from the girl and Udo acknowledged her
presence by a bow.</p>

<p>“Under other circumstances,” he said with stiff politeness,
“I should be glad to extend the hospitalities
of Winden Schloss. But, of course, as Miss Mather
can see, my mother and sisters are away and I——”</p>

<p>“Of course, Graf von Winden, it is understood,”
she said haltingly in German.</p>

<p>“I can do nothing, Fräulein. I am powerless—at
the orders of General von Stromberg, who arranges
the coming and the going of all at Windenberg.”</p>

<p>“The coming, Udo,” said Hammersley dryly. “Not
the going.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, I have done what I could. You have
done well to give me the papers. I shall now go back
to Blaufelden and return them to Excellenz.”</p>

<p>Hammersley started up.</p>

<p>“You mean that you will leave us here?”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Natürlich.</i> I do not wish to see you killed against
the kitchen wall. It is not the death for the blood of
von Eppingen. Even if you are shot while escaping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
it would be better.” He shrugged. “My position is
this. You can do Germany no further harm. I shall
tell a likely story. I have the papers—they are what
I came for. If you had not given them to me I would
have killed you, but now I shall go away alone as I
came.”</p>

<p>“Good old Udo!” said Hammersley impulsively, taking
a pace toward him, his hand outstretched.</p>

<p>But von Winden’s automatic came quickly into line
and Hammersley halted.</p>

<p>“One moment, my cousin,” said von Winden coolly.
“I am quite willing to accept your expressions of
gratitude from a distance. I may not wish to see you
killed by others, and I would regret the necessity of
killing you myself. I shall consider you my prisoner
until I go. After that”—and he shrugged expressively—“you
can go where you like.”</p>

<p>Hammersley folded his arms and frowned.</p>

<p>“Where I like!” he muttered. “With every village
in Hesse-Nassau on the lookout for me.” There was
a pause, after which von Winden spoke with quiet
earnestness. “Unfortunately I may not help you further.
Since there is food, to wait here is safer. Alone,
traveling by night, a man might reach Basel safely.
As for the Fräulein, if she will return to Blaufelden
and give herself up, imprisonment for a time is perhaps
the worst that she need fear.”</p>

<p>Doris had risen, the white light from the door of the
cavern searching her face pitilessly.</p>

<p>“It is what I would do,” she said haltingly. “What
I have pleaded with him to let me do. Cyril,” she implored
in English, “you must let me.”</p>

<p>“I will think about it,” he muttered. “You are
sure that no harm will come to her?” The muzzle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the automatic had wavered out of line again and
Hammersley was carefully measuring with his eye the
distance that separated him from his cousin.</p>

<p>“The bark of Excellenz is much worse than his bite.
He will bluster and storm. But eventually he will return
Miss Mather to her own people.”</p>

<p>Hammersley was shaking his head in indecision.</p>

<p>“I am not so sure that I agree with you about the
bite of Excellenz. I shall think of what I will do.
I’m sure of one thing, Udo,” he said with sincerity,
“that I am deeply grateful for what you have done.
The war has made us enemies, and you have now prevented
the success of my great venture. But I bear
you no illwill. The debt is still mine on account of
your silence, back there—a debt made deeper by the
presence of Fräulein Mather.” He paused to give his
words effect. “I had not told you, Udo, for at Windenberg
one has no time to think of the gentler things of
life. But just before the war broke out Fräulein
Mather had promised me to become my wife.”</p>

<p>Hammersley watched von Winden as he turned toward
Doris with a smile, bowing deeply, his sense of
the situation lost for a second in the obligations of
civility, as he murmured a phrase of congratulations.
“I am much honored by your confidences,” he said formally,
“and I deeply regret——”</p>

<p>He got no further, for Hammersley had sprung in
suddenly toward him, risking Udo’s shot, which was
fired quickly, without aim.</p>

<p>A furious struggle followed. Hammersley caught
at von Winden’s wrist and his weight bore him back
against the rock, while both of them fought for the
possession of the weapon. The German officer was
smaller than his cousin but his wrists were good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
he was quicker than Hammersley. They bore only
friendship for each other but the incentive of each
was greater even than hatred could have been. They
struggled in silence, the thought of the possession of
the papers uppermost in the minds of both. The
struggle was not that of kinsman against kinsman, but
of England against Germany. Realizing the desperateness
of Hammersley’s attack and the purpose of
it, von Winden knew that a victory for Hammersley
meant the loss of the papers and so he was bent on
killing his cousin if he could, Hammersley on preventing
him from doing so. They swayed from side
to side, breathing hard, while Doris crouched against
the side of the cavern, dumb with terror. Twice she
saw the weapon in the German officer’s hand point
downward toward Cyril’s back and then, before it
could be used, saw Cyril’s arm quickly push it upward.
She knew that she was in danger, but she did not know
what to do. At one moment von Winden seemed to
have the advantage and in another Cyril. Udo’s back
was against the wall and one of Cyril’s arms was
around him, while their legs were intertwined as each
tried to get the other off his balance. Suddenly with
an effort Hammersley managed to wrench the pistol
from von Winden’s hand and he tossed it into the corner
of the cavern.</p>

<p>Von Winden had every ethical right to kill Hammersley
if he could, but after what his cousin had done
for him, Hammersley could not kill Udo. That was
impossible. He must succeed without that. This generosity
nearly proved fatal to him for the German
managed to reach Hammersley’s automatic in his own
holster and had almost disengaged it when Hammersley
caught his hand again, and the struggle was renewed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
But Doris, whose senses and initiative had
slowly returned to her, now crept around the walls of
the cave and when von Winden’s outstretched hand
came within her reach she seized his forearm in both
of her hands and clung to it desperately, keeping the
muzzle pointed away from Cyril. She was swayed to
and fro with the struggling men, who finally toppled
sideways and fell to the floor, dragging her with them,
but von Winden’s grasp of the weapon, never quite
secure, was loosened and, as they dropped, it went
flying under the table.</p>

<p>The fight was soon out of the German, for Hammersley’s
weight had fallen on him heavily, and in a
moment the officer was flat on his back and Hammersley
was sitting on him. Doris, who had meanwhile picked
up the pistol, now heard Hammersley gasping jerkily.</p>

<p>“Quick, Doris—something to tie with—your stay-strings!”</p>

<p>She understood and disappeared outside the cavern,
returning presently with the bonds, helping Cyril while
he made the wrists and ankles of von Winden fast.</p>

<p>“I might have killed you—but I didn’t,” Hammersley
was gasping. “You saw that, Udo, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“You needn’t make apologies. I would have killed
you. I tried to. It’s too bad—too bad,” he panted.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” Hammersley repeated. “Those papers—they’re
England’s, Udo. They’re my property. I’ve
got to take them.”</p>

<p>And without further words he put his hand inside
the breast of the officer’s coat and took the papers
out.</p>

<p>“I wish it were anybody but you,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t think you can get away with them.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to try.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ll prevent you if I can.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you.” And with the remnants of his
breath he shouted lustily for help. Hammersley threw
him back, none too gently, and clapped a handkerchief
in his mouth, while he directed Doris to tear her under-skirt
and make bandages for a gag. They worked
quickly and in a moment the German officer was silent
and helpless. Then for a long moment Hammersley
sat by the prostrate man, slowly recovering his breath.
Doris, ash-gray with fear, crouched beside him, obedient
to his look and action. At last with a laugh he
got up.</p>

<p>“Close thing, that!” he said. “My word! He nearly
got me.” And then with a look at the prostrate man,
“Poor old Udo!”</p>

<p>In a moment, with a word to Doris, he went outside
the cave and listened intently. He peered cautiously
over the ridge of rocks. The road was deserted. The
sound of the shot, while it had seemed deafening, would
have been muffled at the entrance of the cavern and
could not have been heard from a distance. And when
Hammersley returned, he reassured Doris as to the
immediate danger of discovery.</p>

<p>“There is no hurry, Doris. I must think,” he said,
filling his pipe. He stood upright for a while, puffing
rapidly, peering down at the captive, his expression
struggling between a frown and a smile. Herr Graf
Udo von Winden looked so very much like a mummy!
The eyes of his cousin, the only visible part of his face,
followed Hammersley intently.</p>

<p>“I could have done for you, Udo,” Hammersley repeated.
“I want to be sure that you understand that.”</p>

<p>Von Winden’s head moved ever so slightly. Doris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
had sunk upon the stool, her face buried in her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s cruel!” she murmured. “Let him go,
Cyril.”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” said Hammersley coolly. “He’d raise a
rumpus. Wouldn’t you, Udo?”</p>

<p>The officer’s head did not move.</p>

<p>“You see?” said Hammersley. “But I’m going to
make him as comfortable as possible.” And taking
him by the armpits he dragged his cousin over to the
corner and laid him gently on the bed of balsam, and
then stood beside the bed looking down at him thoughtfully,
addressing him impersonally in English, as
though thinking aloud.</p>

<p>“What’s to become of you, when we go, old chap—that’s
what’s bothering me now.”</p>

<p>The German’s shoulders moved slightly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all very well, but I can’t leave you up
here to rot, my cousin. No one knows the way to the
Crag of the Thorwald. You might be here a thousand
years if Lindberg shouldn’t come.”</p>

<p>Von Winden made no sign. It was obvious that he
had no further intention of helping in the solution of
the difficulty.</p>

<p>“Let me stay here with him, Cyril,” Doris was
pleading again. “It can do me no harm, and when you
are well on your way, I will release him and go back
to Blaufelden.”</p>

<p>“I can’t take that chance. You’re going with me.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“To England.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“Leave that to me. At present we must have breakfast.
Do you know it’s almost ten o’clock?”</p>

<p>Bewildered, she watched him go to the large tin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
box in the corner of the cavern, from which he brought
forth some dry salt biscuit and several pieces of chocolate.</p>

<p>“It isn’t much, but it’s the best I can do. There’s
tea, too, but I don’t dare light the fire.”</p>

<p>She ate, slowly at first, for the food seemed to choke
her, but she recalled the fact that except for two pieces
of toast and the chocolate of von Stromberg she had
eaten nothing since yesterday morning. Cyril, who
never seemed at a loss for anything, produced a metal
pitcher and going outside the cave for a moment
returned with it full of water.</p>

<p>“Lindberg’s,” he said in reply to her question. “His
food, too. Good old Lindberg.”</p>

<p>He frowned and then went over to the prisoner.</p>

<p>“You needn’t tell me if you don’t care to, Udo, but
I’d like to know how Lindberg is. Will you answer
me?”</p>

<p>Von Winden nodded.</p>

<p>“He is able to be about?”</p>

<p>He nodded again.</p>

<p>“Did His Excellency suspect?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“Thank God. Then Lindberg is at liberty?”</p>

<p>Udo replied in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Hammersley gave a gasp of relief.</p>

<p>“That is well. I need not worry. He will come
and release you.”</p>

<p>Von Winden only frowned.</p>

<p>“Listen, Udo,” went on Hammersley quickly,
“Fräulein Mather and I are going down from here,
leaving you alone. It can’t be helped. You’ve stumbled
up here and you’ve got to take your chance. In
time you may wear the strings through against a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
rock. If you don’t return to Blaufelden by tomorrow,
Lindberg will find you.”</p>

<p>“But suppose anything happened to Lindberg,”
Doris was whispering. “Ah, Cyril, it would be terrible
to leave him here. I should dream of it every night
of my life.”</p>

<p>Udo’s eyes smiled at her.</p>

<p>“There is little danger. Graf von Winden is not a
man to be so easily beaten. He will get away by tonight.
But in the meanwhile we will have gone far
enough to be out of his reach.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going?”</p>

<p>“To England, child—in the Yellow Dove,” he
laughed.</p>

<p>Doris started away from him, her eyes suddenly
brilliant with excitement, and the prisoner, who had
lain without movement, showed sudden signs of activity,
his eyes frowning and his head wagging in anxiety.</p>

<p>“He wants to speak,” said Doris.</p>

<p>Hammersley bent over his cousin.</p>

<p>“Will you promise not to shout?”</p>

<p>Von Winden nodded quickly. So Hammersley untied
the bandages that held the handkerchief in the prisoner’s
mouth and helped him to a sitting posture.</p>

<p>“You must not go,” he stammered quickly in German.
“It is impossible. You will fail. I warn you.”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so?”</p>

<p>“The machines are guarded, and the spark-plugs of
your Taube have been removed and hidden.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” said Hammersley thoughtfully. “Excellenz
neglects nothing.”</p>

<p>“You would go to your death.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. Thanks for the warning,” said Hammersley
bluntly. “I’m going just the same.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Von Winden looked at him in amazement. “You do
not believe me?” he asked. “It is the truth, I tell
you.”</p>

<p>“I shall find a way.”</p>

<p>“But there is no way. You think that I am trying
to persuade you to escape by the mountains so that
you may be captured with the papers?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I could not escape that way now. You
know it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but what you plan is insane.”</p>

<p>“Fortune favors the fool. I’ve made up my mind.”</p>

<p>“Then you deserve to be shot,” said Udo. “In the
forest at least you would have a chance—<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach</i>—!” He
gave a guttural exclamation and then: “Bind me and
leave me then—quickly. It’s good-by.”</p>

<p>“Good-by, Udo,” said Hammersley with a smile.
“We’ll meet again, when Hesse-Nassau is an English
province.”</p>

<p>“Bah, Cyril,” said von Winden. “I have always
said that you were a fool.”</p>

<p>Hammersley replaced the gag and bound it into
place with great care, smiling the while. Then he removed
the belt which contained his cousin’s supply of
cartridges and fastened it around his own body above
Lindberg’s, loading the two weapons with care and
placing them in their holsters.</p>

<p>Doris watched these preparations anxiously, but
Hammersley made her eat her fill of chocolate and biscuits
and when they had finished, he went to the corner
of the cavern and brought forth a large and heavy
parcel which he put on the table and opened. Doris
saw that Captain von Winden was straightening on
the couch trying to see what it contained. Hammersley
did not even glance in his direction. He seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
to know by instinct that Udo’s curiosity had gotten
the better of his dignity. He opened the package deliberately
and spread the contents out upon the table.</p>

<p>“Spare parts of the Taube, Udo. I’ve had them
here for weeks. I’ll let you have a peep at ’em if you
like. A socket-wrench, spark-plugs, bolts, nuts and
wire—by Jove—we might have used that on Udo.”</p>

<p>“You are afraid that what he says is true,” whispered
Doris anxiously. “Von Stromberg is prepared
for you.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” he said.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>HARE AND HOUNDS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">For two hours or more, Hammersley and the
girl, taking turn and turn, watched the road
and forest from the amphitheater of rocks.
The road in times of peace was a short route from
Windenberg to Schöndorf and popular with the market-folk.
But the restrictions put upon visits to Blaufelden
had resulted in the diversion of traffic from the
south slope of the mountains to the longer road in the
valley upon the other side. The few who appeared
were men in uniform. From his lofty perch Hammersley
espied Captain Wentz as he hurried by with
several men in an automobile. Just beyond the crag
the automobile was stopped and the men dismounted
and went on afoot. Clearly they meant to continue the
search abroad. Hammersley chuckled.</p>

<p>“Hare and hounds!” he muttered to himself. “The
more men to the eastward, the fewer to the west. By
Jove!”</p>

<p>The expletive was not unusual with Hammersley
but the manner of its utterance gave it importance.
He crossed the level quickly and peered again at the
vanishing figures of the men. A new idea had been
born. Hare and hounds! A game he had played at
Eton—a game as old as sport, as old as hunting! And
for such a prize!</p>

<p>He hurried into the cave, glancing hurriedly at his
watch. It was noon. Doris sat upon the stool near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Udo von Winden. Hammersley went over to their captive
and examined his bonds and then gave the girl a
few hasty instructions.</p>

<p>“I am going down below to be gone two—perhaps
three hours.”</p>

<p>A quick intake of the breath escaped her but she
caught her under lip in her teeth and said nothing.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” he went on cheerfully, “I’m coming
back. I’ll promise you that. I’ve got a plan,” he
whispered, “a new plan, a noble plan, a plan that will
make our game an easy one. It will be harder for you
than for me, Doris, because you’ve only got to sit and
wait and try to be patient.”</p>

<p>While he was talking he had taken off the belts that
contained the two pistols, fastening one around Doris.
Then he took off his leather jacket and put it on the
table, fastening the other belt containing Udo’s cartridges
and automatic over his gray sweater. She
watched him timidly.</p>

<p>“But suppose Graf von Winden should get his arms
free,” she protested. “I cannot shoot him, Cyril—I
cannot—not that——”</p>

<p>“He won’t trouble you. I’ll arrange that.” He
took from his coat pocket the documents captured
from the Emperor’s messenger and held them up so
that Udo von Winden could see them.</p>

<p>“I must leave you for a while, Udo. Awfully sorry,
but it’s most urgent.” He laughed. “You won’t mind,
will you? Or try to make things difficult?”</p>

<p>He turned quickly and while both the girl and the
prisoner wondered what he was about to do, he went
to the tin box in the corner, brought out a new candle,
lighted it and held the papers so that the prisoner
could see them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you observe what I am doing, Udo? Miss
Mather will sit here upon the opposite side of the cave.
If you attempt to get up from your bed, she will burn
the papers. Simple, isn’t it? Also quite effective.
She doesn’t want to shoot you, Udo—nor do I. And
of course if the papers were burned, it wouldn’t hurt
England a great deal. As long as the papers are in
Germany, my capture may throw them into German
hands, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nicht wahr</i>?”</p>

<p>Udo von Winden’s head moved slightly from left to
right.</p>

<p>With an <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">auf wiedersehen</i> thrown over his shoulder
at Udo, Hammersley went outside the cave, where
Doris followed him. She was on the point of tears,
but she succeeded in a smile.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Doris, old girl. Just going down
for a stroll about.”</p>

<p>“But why, Cyril?”</p>

<p>“Goin’ to throw ’em off the scent,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“But they’re already off the scent.”</p>

<p>For answer he kissed her gently and bade her keep
up her courage. Then he gave her the papers, saw
her inside the cave again and in a moment was gone.</p>

<p>The more Hammersley thought of his plan the better
it seemed to him. The day was still young. In
three hours he could do much. He crossed the amphitheater
of rocks and followed the rocky gorge by
which he had entered last night and when he emerged
upon the farther side, paused and watched for a while
to be sure that Wentz and his men were not in sight
and then descended the face of the rocks skillfully and
in a moment was creeping on all fours through the
underbrush up the side of the mountain. It was steep
here and rugged, but in a while he reached the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
deer trail over which he had passed when he had
doubled on his pursuers last night. But instead of
following it, he halted a moment to listen and then
crossed into the undergrowth which at this point was
so thick that at twenty paces even he was not visible.
He slipped among the treetrunks and evergreens, moving
rapidly, making a wide circle up the mountainside
almost to its top, descending then by easy stages, until
he had covered four miles at least when he bore slowly
down toward the Schöndorf road.</p>

<p>Hare and hounds! An exciting game even in the
old days when it meant athletic honors, but now, with
the alternatives of death as the penalty of capture and
a great triumph as the reward of escape, it made his
blood run madly. A good game—a fair game, with
success as the reward of intelligence.</p>

<p>He planned carefully. He must be sure to come
down into the open at a spot beyond where Wentz and
his men were searching. He knew the country well.
There was a village on the hillside, half a mile below.
It was midway between Schöndorf and the farm house
at Blaufelden. The families of some of the foresters
lived there and there was telephonic connection both
with the farm and Windenberg. All of the men of
Mittelwald who were not in the Forest Service were off
at the front and the chances were that unless Wentz
and his men were there, Hammersley would see only
women and children. But he knew that von Stromberg
had neglected nothing that would give an inkling of
his whereabouts and his presence would be at once
reported and the chase begin. He was in excellent condition,
trained a little too fine perhaps for an Englishman,
but fit. He had done little running since leaving
the University, and though he had lost some of his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
speed, he could rely upon the thought of his danger
and Doris’s to provide the incentive for extraordinary
effort.</p>

<p>Mittelwald lay in a clearing similar to that at Blaufelden,
and its farms, if farms they could be called,
clambered up the hillside and straggled over beyond
the road where they were merged into the undergrowth
of young oaks. The Schöndorf road, curving this way
and that, passed between the houses, which were set at
irregular intervals, like the strips on the tail of a kite.
He went on through the underbrush, coming out into
the open upon the road at the point where it entered
the woods upon the Schöndorf side. Then he settled
his automatic loosely in its sheath, and went forward
boldly. His eye had marked the line of the telephone
wire and followed it to the gable of one of the largest
houses in the village. It was to this house that he
made his way. A young woman was working in the
garden and he approached her quietly and politely, but
with an air of a man not to be trifled with, asked for
food. He was aware that he was unshorn, covered with
mud, and that his face was streaked with dirt and perspiration,
but he knew that his appearance alone could
not have accounted for the sudden blanching of the
woman’s face and the air of alarm with which she regarded
him. She straightened and fell back two or
three paces toward the house, unable to speak a word
in reply. So he repeated his request, while her mouth
gaped at him and her eyes grew rounder. At last
she managed to stammer,</p>

<p>“Food! You are hungry?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Potato bread—anything, but quickly. I will
go with you to the house.” And he indicated the
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>She stumbled on before him, her head jerking anxiously
this way and that over her shoulder as though
she feared at any moment to receive a blow or a shot
in the back. But he followed her indoors and noted
with satisfaction that she appeared after all to be a
woman of some intelligence. A thing that pleased him
further was the telephone instrument in the corner.</p>

<p>“Milk, if you please, and quickly. I will take the
bread with me.” And while she timorously brought
them out, “Who lives here?”</p>

<p>“F-Förster Habermehl.”</p>

<p>“Where is he?” peremptorily.</p>

<p>“At Windenberg.”</p>

<p>“Oh! There are no men here?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“That is well, then.” He drank a glass of milk
greedily and tore off a piece of the loaf. “You are
a good girl. Heaven will reward you.” He made his
way to the door, looking out cautiously, and then
turned and put his hand in his pocket, bringing out a
piece of money. “See,” he laughed, “I have concluded
to reward you myself. Cash. Much better than hopes,
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">nicht wahr</i>?”</p>

<p>She fetched a timorous smile and bobbed shyly.</p>

<p>“You will do me a favor,” he said in a whisper as
he went out of the door, “if you will tell no one of my
visit.”</p>

<p>And with that, chuckling to himself, went down the
road again in the direction of Schöndorf, watching the
turn in the road below the village for a glimpse of
Wentz and his men. Before he reached the edge of the
open country he paused and listened. From the house
that he had visited came the faint tinkle of a bell.
Frau Habermehl had lost no time. She had notified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the master of the hounds who was clamoring for the
scent.</p>

<p>Hammersley walked around the turn in the road,
which hid him from the house, and then went into the
bushes where he sat on a fallen log, peeping through
the leaves toward the further side of the clearing,
where General von Stromberg’s men must appear. He
did not know how long he would have to wait. Half
an hour, perhaps longer. If he knew anything of von
Stromberg, they would come in every sort of available
vehicle, from a high-powered machine to a donkey cart,
picking up the misguided Wentz and his men upon the
way to follow this new scent. It was difficult to sit
still and wait. Hammersley wanted a smoke awfully,
but he chewed a twig instead, for he needed to keep
his wind in good condition and had purposely left his
pipe at the Thorwald. He did not want to get too far
away from Doris. By the way he intended to return
he was now at least six miles from the cavern and
with the mile or so he must go toward Schöndorf before
he turned, a good eight miles of rough going lay
between himself and safety.</p>

<p>Under other circumstances, he would have greatly
enjoyed the chance for a rest. With a cooler wind
from the northeast the weather had cleared and the
period of higher temperatures through which they had
passed seemed to be drawing to a close. In spite of
the doubts that hung about his plan, he couldn’t help
saying to himself that he felt jolly fit.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes—twenty-five. He got up and
stretched his long limbs luxuriously. The hare was
ready. It was time they cast forward the hounds. A
peep through the bushes showed him Frau Habermehl
standing near her home watching the road to Windenberg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
So he came out of his place of concealment and
stood in the open again until he was sure that she saw
him, when he turned and went slowly toward Schöndorf.
He had planned his moment nicely for before
he was out of sight of the clearing, an automobile came
into view—paused a moment before Frau Habermehl
and then came on rapidly.</p>

<p>Hammersley waited until they had “viewed” him
and then cut into the woods to his left, slipping from
tree to tree not fifty yards in the cover when the
machine came to a stop and the men jumped down and
came after him. He did not know who was in command
and did not care, but just to show them that he
was the man they were after, he risked a shot with his
automatic and then sped along rapidly, working up
the mountainside, following in a general way the direction
of Schöndorf. He heard them plunging after him
in full cry and the sound of their footsteps made
him move at a rare pace. He knew well this piece of
woods, and in a moment came to a path which curved
to the right, leading straight up the mountain. When
he reached it he paused to look over his shoulder. It
was difficult to see the green uniforms, but there was a
flash of light from a patch of fir trees and a twig just
above his head fell across his path. His curiosity was
satisfied. He shut his mouth and, breathing through
his nostrils, went off with a burst of speed which put
him around a turn in the path before any of the green
uniforms had come into sight. He had them coming
now, two—three men—one little one and two big ones.
He caught a glimpse of them in a moment when the
path came into a glade of rocks and barrens. There
was his danger. A chance shot might get him when
they emerged, before he found the cover again. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
leaping from rock to rock he managed to reach the
path upon the other side, and their shots went wild.</p>

<p>When he reached cover he halted a moment for a
breath, firing a shot in the direction of the advancing
men, who promptly dropped to cover. And when they
came on again, he had gained a clear lead of a hundred
yards or more.</p>

<p>He had foreseen his greatest danger—of being
caught in thick underbrush and surrounded—so he kept
to the main path, only leaving it for a smaller and
more tortuous one, when the other turned down the
mountain toward the road again. Since the exchange
of shots his pursuers had become more cautious and
when they reached the fork of the paths they stopped,
sweating in their heavy coats and cursing lustily, while
they debated upon the question as to which path he
had taken. The hounds were at fault. From a point
above, he could see them quite clearly and one of them
was the Fatalist who had been his jailor last evening.
Just to discover whether he was sincere in his philosophy,
Hammersley sent a bullet skipping above his
head. He ducked and Hammersley laughed.</p>

<p>“Silly ass!” he muttered. “Fatalist! Fatality if
I’d aimed at him!”</p>

<p>And he was off again, for other men had joined the
leaders and the scent was hot. He carried them fast,
up to the bald top of the mountain where the going was
faster, and down in the valley to the right. They had
gained nothing on him and Hammersley with his second
wind was breathing more easily, but it was almost time
to double. Here was as good a place as another for
the pack of them to spend the afternoon and he made
up his mind to lose them without further ado. There
was only one runner in the lot and he was the Fatalist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
though how he had ever happened to learn to run in
the Imperial Navy, Hammersley had not the time or
inclination to decide. If his philosophy limped, his
legs at least were strong and he came on rapidly leaping
like a young buck toward the opening over the
crest of the knob into which Hammersley had disappeared.
A short way down was a spur of rock, the
beginnings of a ridge which cut out into the hills,
the watershed of two rills which leaped from rock to
rock to the valleys below. Hammersley chose the
right-hand valley for the going was better, and went
down it at top speed for a quarter of a mile or more,
pausing where the path led into the underbrush and
pines until the Fatalist should view him when he disappeared,
and then turning into the thicket circled
quickly to the left, and taking advantage of every
cover, slowly and carefully climbed the ridge to a
place of vantage where he crouched and waited, to have
the satisfaction a moment later of seeing his ex-jailor,
weapon in hand, go plunging down the path past his
place of concealment.</p>

<p>Hammersley listened a moment to the sounds of
crashing feet in front of him and behind, and then,
creeping slowly and making what speed he could,
crossed the ridge and in a while was out of sight and
hearing of them. He feared little in crossing the other
valley, for his pursuers were strung out in a line, each
in sight of the other, and would follow the leader like
a flock of sheep. But there was little time to waste
and the greatest test of Hammersley’s endurance and
Doris’s was to come. For two, perhaps three hours,
these men would search for him, and more would come.
The Fatalist would bear the brunt of their failure, but
in the meanwhile Hammersley must reach the cave in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
the Thorwald and take Doris to Blaufelden. The first
part of the return run must be done at top speed to
save time which would be needed later. So when he
crossed the second valley in safety and had reached the
mountaintop, Hammersley abandoned all caution, risking
the chance of meeting Wentz and his men, and with
a sharp lookout ahead of him went as fast as he could
along the ridge, finding at last the trail by which he
had come earlier in the day, down which he ran with a
long stride which covered the four miles in less than
half an hour. He reached the upper passage to the
cave in safety and in a moment was safe behind the
projecting bowlders of the amphitheater. He was
breathing heavily, and the sweat was pouring from
him. Doris was watching for him.</p>

<p>“They’re following you? They’re coming?” she
asked nervously.</p>

<p>He quieted her and led her inside the cave, where
he dropped for a moment of rest upon the stool. Doris
watched him anxiously. In a moment he was laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, I led ’em a rippin’ run straight for Schöndorf,”
he gasped. “They’re pattin’ me out—six miles
from here—on the top of the Schmalzberg. Lord!” he
grinned, “but that was a breather.”</p>

<p>She brought him the pitcher of water but he only
rinsed his mouth.</p>

<p>“How are you feelin’? Fit?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Right-o. Come along. We’re off.”</p>

<p>He went over to the prisoner and examined his bonds
carefully.</p>

<p>“Poor old Udo!” he muttered in German. “I’ve got
to go. You might worry through those strings. It’s
the only way, because I’m not leaving any matches.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>He leaned over and patted his cousin on the shoulder.
“Good-by, Udo,” he said. “We’ll meet again,
some day, as friends, my cousin—as friends.”</p>

<p>Von Winden’s eyes met Hammersley’s and then he
lowered his head upon the balsam boughs.</p>

<p>There was no time for amenities. Hammersley
slipped on his leather jacket and cap, fastening his belt
outside, reloaded his automatic, filled the pockets of
Doris’s coat with biscuit and chocolate, then made a
bundle of the tools and spare parts, which he selected
carefully, and in a moment he and Doris were outside
on the ridge, peering over toward the road below. All
was quiet, and they descended carefully to the projecting
rock, pausing there to listen again. The machine
of Wentz, which had been left near the crag, had
gone on toward Mittelwald. Hammersley smiled. The
plan had worked. It was working. They <em>must</em> succeed.</p>

<p>Down in the bushes at the foot of the crag by the
road they paused again, listening, and then Hammersley
went forward, peering out, up and down the
road. Silence. Solitude. Leading the way, with the
hand of the girl in his, he quickly crossed and plunged
into the undergrowth silently until they had reached a
distance which would defy detection from the road.
Then Hammersley bore to the right and went on rapidly.</p>

<p>Doris’s heart was beating high with excitement and
hope. The Yellow Dove! Could they reach the hangar
safely, and when there could they tune up undetected?
The success of the venture seemed impossible
for there must still be men on guard at Blaufelden—someone!
But as they went on through the wood, she
found some of the contagion of Cyril’s audacity. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
seemed tireless. When they reached a trail which led
in the desired direction, without speaking to her, he set
forward into a steady jog trot which put them well
upon their way. He turned around from time to time
and watched her, and when he saw that she was nearly
blown he slowed down to a walk and explained his plan.</p>

<p>“Jolly flyin’ weather this. Once we’re in the air
they can’t stop us, Doris. She’s armored around the
cockpit and engines, and they haven’t anything heavier
than a rifle at Blaufelden. We’ll go up the Rhine to
the sea, flyin’ high. Then cut to the left along the
coast, as far as the French line, and then go in to
Ypres and from there to General French’s headquarters.
You can easily tell by the lines of trenches. I
want you to listen carefully. I’ve got two seats and
double control. The arrangement is just the same as
on your Nieuport, only she answers her control much
more slowly. The wheel is on a universal joint; the
gas, on your wheel, the spark to your left, the magneto,
a button in front of you. She starts by compressed
air.”</p>

<p>“But the exhaust, Cyril,” she gasped, “before we
go—it’s only a few hundred yards from the shed to
the house!”</p>

<p>“We’re going to risk that. With luck we’ll be
movin’ in three minutes, and then——” He paused
grimly.</p>

<p>“And then——?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see a dozen stop us.”</p>

<p>He had such perfect assurance that all doubt left
her. Indeed, to Doris, he seemed endowed with some
hidden fount of initiative and inspiration, and she was
willing to believe anything he told her. They went on
rapidly, while he answered all her questions and gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
her final instructions, until at last they reached a path,
the same, he told her, by which they had come from
the farm last night. They started up a frightened
deer, which fled away from them, but they didn’t pause
until the path cut sharply to the right and through
the bushes they could see the buildings of Blaufelden.
There they stopped and Hammersley went forward to
investigate.</p>

<p>In the direction of the farmhouse was no sign of
animation except the thread of smoke that rose from
the kitchen chimney. The back of the hangar was just
in front of them, a bare wall of wood, a hundred and
fifty feet long. The opening was upon the other side,
to the west, a huge canvas flap, toggled at the bottom
to rings in the sill. Hammersley came back and whispered
to Doris to follow him. Until the starting of
the engine, this was the most hazardous part of the
proceeding, for, if they were seen from the house, there
would be no time for Hammersley to put the engines
in order. He led her south to a point in the woods
where the storehouse hid them from the main buildings,
when, crouching low to avoid possible detection from
the Windenberg road, they covered the fifty yards to
the storehouse and waited again, completely hidden
from all points except the forest behind them, while
Cyril looked around the edge of the building, and then
beckoned to her to follow. In a moment they had
slipped between the end of the canvas flap and the
door, and were within the dusky interior of the shed.</p>

<p>Before them stretched the wide expanse of the Yellow
Dove, a huge biplane with a spread, as nearly as
Doris could figure it, of a hundred and twenty feet
from tip to tip. She stood before it in wonder and
awe, admiring its fine lines and sturdy appearance. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
dragon-fly her Nieuport was beside this great eagle of
the air. The other machine, an Etrich monoplane,
which was used by Udo von Winden, seemed lost in
the shadows of the larger wings. Doris stood quite
still, as Cyril had directed, while he moved off noiselessly
in the dim light. She saw him slipping from one
spot to another, quickly examining this and that, and
at last saw him climb up into the machine with his kit
of tools. She came nearer as he whispered down to
her:</p>

<p>“They’ve taken out some plugs. I’ll have ’em in
shortly.” And then: “Go around the lower plane and
tell me if the guys are all taut.”</p>

<p>She did as he asked, while she heard him above working
over the engines.</p>

<p>“How long will it take?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell—twenty minutes, perhaps. The petrol
tanks are empty, too.”</p>

<p>“I want to help.”</p>

<p>“Are the wires all fast?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Good. Then bring me the hose from the petrol
tank. It’s there beside you in the corner. You can
run it in while I’m workin’.”</p>

<p>She did as she was bid, climbing up with a feeling of
exultation into the tall machine beside him.</p>

<p>“The reserve tank first—” he whispered. “Up here
between the planes. Here’s a wrench. The opening is
on the top.”</p>

<p>They worked side by side, noiselessly and efficiently,
Hammersley fitting the missing spark-plugs and connecting
a new coil wire which had been removed. He
looked over the machine carefully, but could find nothing
else missing, or even needing adjustment, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
had taken care yesterday morning, as was his custom,
to go over the engine with his own hands. The impairment
of the engine was of no serious consequence, and
intended only to delay. Von Stromberg had not
counted on such a chance for readjustment as this, or
upon Hammersley’s reserve supply of necessary material.
And unless they had done something else that
he could not discover—but what? While he worked
Hammersley tried to think, casting between times anxious
glances at the gears, the propellers and the control
wires. The reserve tank of petrol was filled and
the hose was steadily pouring the stuff into the one under
the forward cockpit, which was full by the time the
plugs and wires were all adjusted.</p>

<p>“That will be enough, Doris,” he whispered. “We
only need to get to the English lines. There’s no time
for more.”</p>

<p>She saw him try the wheel, watching the connecting
gear keenly, and, when he ordered it, she climbed down
into the rear seat. He gave her a leather coat, gloves
and helmet, and buckled her into her seat. Then, in
a state of nervous tension, they waited. She saw Cyril
climb down, coolly wiping his hands with a piece of
waste, restore the hose to its place, and then peer out
from a slit in the canvas door. Then he bent over,
and running quickly along the flap from side to side,
one after another quickly unfastened the toggles which
held it in place.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to chance it now,” he whispered up to
her. “If she doesn’t work—God help us——”</p>

<p>“But the canvas——”</p>

<p>“The machine will——”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, for Doris’s eyes were staring
in panic at something behind him. Hammersley whirled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
quickly toward the slit in the canvas, his automatic in
his hand. There, not four paces away, blinking into
the dusk, stood the tall figure of His Excellency, General
Graf von Stromberg.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>




<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>FROM THE HEIGHTS</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hammersley had him covered, and the General
made no move to defend himself. He
bent his head and folded his arms, peering
into Hammersley’s eyes like a short-sighted man trying
to adjust his vision to an unaccustomed task. But his
frown relaxed almost immediately and his lips separated,
showing a gleam of teeth.</p>

<p>“My compliments, Herr Hammersley,” he said.
“You have done well. It pleases me to meet at
last——”</p>

<p>“Move your right hand again the fraction of an
inch and I will shoot, Excellenz,” said Hammersley, in
the sharp, quick accents of a resolute man.</p>

<p>Von Stromberg only smiled more broadly. But he
did not move. He had seen enough of Herr Hammersley
to respect his sincerity.</p>

<p>“I have staked my professional reputation upon
your presence elsewhere, Herr Hammersley. Instinct,
perhaps, led me here. I do not know what else. But
I came alone. I am not armed.”</p>

<p>Hammersley was in no mood for trifling and time
was flying. Better to shoot the man and be done with
it, but he couldn’t, somehow. Instead he searched him
quickly for weapons.</p>

<p>“You’re too late, Excellenz. I am sorry, but I have
no time for conversation.”</p>

<p>“You will at least let me pay you the compliment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
saying that the Prussian blood in you has made you
the most brilliant Englishman I have ever met.”</p>

<p>“I have no time to match phrases with you——”</p>

<p>“<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach</i>, but you match what is much more important—a
genius for dissimulation. Yesterday you disappointed
me, Herr Hammersley, with your talk of plans—of
fortifications—of Strassburg. I had been hoping
that you were playing a deeper game, something that
would relieve the flat monotony of my routine. You
were to save me from utter boredom. It is true. I
had hoped that. I was disappointed when I thought
that you were like the others. Disappointed! I should
have known——”</p>

<p>“And now that I have the papers—what are you going
to do about it?” asked Hammersley with a touch
of bravado.</p>

<p>Von Stromberg shrugged.</p>

<p>“I confess that I am so rapt in admiration of
your genius that I am at a loss—I must yield to the
inevitable. But I am happy in the knowledge that only
a person of the skill of Herr Hammersley could have
succeeded in outwitting the head of the Secret Service
Department of the Empire.”</p>

<p>“Enough of this!” Hammersley broke in. “I should
kill you, General von Stromberg, but I won’t if you
obey me promptly. Stand aside—over there—against
the wall. If you move, I’ll shoot. I’m going out of
here.”</p>

<p>Von Stromberg did as he was bidden, and his long
strides and erect carriage had lost none of their dignity.
When he reached the wall he turned with a smile.
Then he said suavely:</p>

<p>“I fear, Herr Hammersley, that you will not go
forth as rapidly as you like.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Hammersley only laughed at him.</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that.” He took a stride to the
canvas curtain and had a quick look outside. And
then to the girl: “Crank her, Doris! The compressed
air—the button to the left beside the wheel!”</p>

<p>There was a long pause when Doris reached forward
in her seat. A pause filled with meanings for Hammersley,
in which his fate and hers, was hanging in the
balance. Von Stromberg seemed to read his thoughts,
and the wolfish smile spread again over his face.</p>

<p>“It is just possible,” he said blandly, “that someone
may have been tinkering with the machinery.”</p>

<p>There was another long silence—a moment of agony
for Hammersley.</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>I</em> have,” roared Hammersley exultantly.</p>

<p>For just then there was a violent explosion, deafening
in the enclosed space, like the roar of a giant
cracker would have been—another—and then more
rapidly another, followed by a number of concussions,
like a pack of giant crackers catching intermittently
and then in quick succession.</p>

<p>General von Stromberg’s smile faded—then vanished
in a look of inefficacy and dismay. He was senile.
Hammersley’s grin derided him. Speech was impossible,
but the muzzle of the automatic was as eloquent as
before. One more explosion or six, for that matter,
would add little to the din. Von Stromberg’s life hung
by a hair at that moment and he knew it. Still covering
His Excellency, who was now glancing at the slit
in the curtain beside him, Hammersley climbed up to
the seat in front of Doris in the cockpit of the machine.
And just as he was putting a leg over, His
Excellency took a quick glance upward, which had in
it a world of expression—and bolted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>Hammersley’s shot must have missed. He looked
around at Doris and laughed, and she saw the light of
triumph that rode in his eyes. The exhaust was roaring
steadily now, but with one hand on the wheel and
in the other his automatic, Hammersley sat motionless,
watching the slits in the canvas for the men that he
knew must come in a moment. At a gesture of his,
Doris sank low in the cockpit, her hands on the wheel,
watching, too, and ready to do her share as Cyril had
directed. One—two minutes passed—she seemed to
be counting the seconds. The body of the machine was
trembling as though with the excitement of the moment
and the explosions had blended into one continuous
roar. Cyril threw the clutch in and the note lowered
as the propellers began to whirr. The huge fabric
jumped forward, gathering momentum as it went, until
by the time it reached the canvas curtain in front of
it, it was going as fast as a man would run. The
weight of the heavy flap retarded it for a moment, but
it went steadily on, and the canvas was pushed outward—then
rose—it seemed to Doris like the curtain
on a melodrama. Men were running up, shooting as
they ran. They clutched at the toggles and swung off
their feet, falling in a heap upon the ground. She saw
a man, the only one not in uniform, take hold of the
lower plane and try to stop the momentum. It was
John Rizzio. She saw his face for a second, dark,
handsome, smiling. Cyril rose in his seat and their
weapons streamed fire. Rizzio moved backward with
the machine, still clinging to the lower plane, and then
disappeared, passing under it, just where the blades of
the right-hand propeller were.</p>

<p>A slight shock and a shapeless mass went rolling
over and over until it brought up motionless against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the jamb of the door. Two other men, Foresters,
warned by Rizzio’s fate, sprang aside with horror in
their eyes. Doris sank lower in her seat, her cheeks
bloodless, grasping her wheel with icy hands, filled
with horror. Cyril had sunk down in his seat, clutching
at the side of the cockpit, his weapon falling from
his fingers. With an effort she steadied her hold on
the wheel. The canvas curtain had passed over their
heads. They were in the open. To the right, coming
from the Windenberg road, a machine filled with men
was dashing across the field before them at a diagonal
which would intercept them. She heard shots near at
hand. Cyril did not move. She had a glimpse of General
von Stromberg, who had snatched a pistol from
the hand of the nearest soldier and fired.</p>

<p>They were moving fast. But the automobile in the
field before them seemed to be moving faster—Captain
Wentz and four men! She saw Cyril’s hand rise in
front of her, pointing to the left to avoid them, but
Wentz came on. The Yellow Dove was still running
on its wheels. She saw the danger. Wentz was aiming
at a collision. She pulled her wheel toward her instinctively
and the Yellow Dove rose, skimming the
ground. She felt it lifting, slowly, now rapidly. The
automobile seemed about to strike them. Another jerk
on the wheel and the skids of the Yellow Dove just
grazed the wind-shield of the machine, and a soldier
leaped into the air, trying to catch a hold, missed and
tumbled to the ground. In the car men were shouting
like demons, and a volley of pistol bullets pierced
the planes. She felt them strike the armored body,
but she sank lower, clutching her wheel.</p>

<p>Clear? They must be. A second of agonized suspense
and she saw Cyril turn his head and look down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
behind them. His face was white but his eye flashed
triumph. His lips moved, but she heard nothing.
Safe? They must be. The Yellow Dove, mounting
easily, had cleared the trees at the border of the farm
and before the eyes of the girl stretched only undulating
surfaces of gray and green.</p>

<p>In front of her Cyril lay back in his seat. His
hands clutched the sides of the cockpit. O God! She
had not been sure before what his sudden lassitude had
meant. He had been hit! John Rizzio! He turned
around and smiled at her and one hand, stretched before
him, pointed up and to the right. Her throat
closed and her heart seemed to stop its beating and
the Dove for a moment swung and tossed like a drunken
thing, but with an effort she inclined her wheel and met
it. Cyril again raised his fingers and pointed upwards.
Higher! She tipped the wheel further toward her.
His gesture was like an appeal to Heaven—a symbol
of his faith in her and in the God of both. She set her
lips and obeyed. Broken and helpless—perhaps dying,
he was putting his faith in her. She must not fail him
now.</p>

<p>She kept her gaze before her over Cyril’s head, trying
to gain strength for what she had to do, thinking
that she was in England—at Ashwater Park—and that
the wheel she held was that of her own little Nieuport.
There seemed to be little difference between them, except
that the Yellow Dove was easier to manage. It
responded to the slightest touch, and had a magnificent
steadiness that reassured Doris as to her ability to do
the thing that was required of her.</p>

<p>The mountains had fallen below them and the horizon
had widened until it blurred into the haze of the
distance. She looked down on what seemed to her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
plain of purple velvet touched with lighter patches of
orange and violet. Before her the sun was setting
blood red in a sea of amber. She mounted above it into
the clear empyrean of azure, higher—higher yet. She
felt the exhilaration of large spaces, the joy of conquest
over all material things. Death even did not dismay
her—Cyril’s—her own. She seemed to have
crossed at a bound, from the realm of substance into
that of immateriality. Her soul already sang in accord
with the angels. They were mated. She and Cyril—mated!
And even Death should not separate
them.</p>

<p>Dusk fell slowly below them, like a black giant striding
across the face of the earth, but all was still bright
and clear about her. The red ball of the sun would
not set. She was going upward—upward into the
realm of continuous and perfect day. Below her a
thread of silk, thrown carelessly upon a purple carpet.
The Rhine! She saw Cyril’s hand come up and move
feebly to the right. She turned slowly and followed
its direction. The Rhine—she remembered Cyril’s
words back there in the woods. She must follow the
Rhine to the sea and then turn to the westward along
the coast. She would do it. She must.</p>

<p>Cyril was hurt—but perhaps not badly. His gestures
reassured her. He moved his hand in a level
line in front of him and she understood. They had
mounted high enough. The barograph showed four
thousand feet. She brought the wheel up to normal
and held it there. The wind burned her cheeks and she
knew from the changes in the river below her that the
speed of the Yellow Dove was terrific—ninety miles—a
hundred—a hundred and twenty—an hour—perhaps
much more—she did not know. The speed got into her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
blood. Faster, faster, was the song her pulses sung.
She was a part of the Yellow Dove now, and it was a
part of herself. Its wings were her wings and its instinct
was in her own fingertips.</p>

<p>Night fell slowly, a luminous night full of stars.
She seemed to be hanging among them—to be one of
them—watching the earth pass under her. Two of
them gleamed like St. Elmo’s lights at the tips of the
planes. The sky was clear and bright, of a deep bluish
purple, like the skies she remembered high up on the
plains of the great West in her own country. The air
was bitter cold upon her face and she blessed Cyril’s
foresight for the helmet, gloves and old leather jacket
that he had put on her in the hangar. In front of her
Cyril leaned slightly to one side and his right hand
touched a button, throwing an electric light in a hood
in front of the wheel upon the face of the compass
and barograph. She glanced at them quickly—four
thousand feet—the direction north-northwest. She
longed to speak to him and shouted his name. But in
the roar of the engines she could not hear her own
voice.</p>

<p>He still sat up, the fingers of his right hand moving
from time to time as he gave her the direction. She
thanked God for that—he was alive—he would live
until they reached Ypres. He <em>must</em> live. He <em>must</em>.
She set her teeth upon the words and <em>willed</em> it, praying
at last aloud with lips that screamed yet made no
sound.</p>

<p>Below her moved the lights of a city. She did not
know what it was. Cologne, perhaps. She had passed
it yesterday morning in the train with John Rizzio.
Yesterday! It seemed a year ago. Cologne—then
Dusseldorf. The river was not difficult to follow. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
lost it once and then moving at a lower altitude she
found it quickly. But the old terror was gripping her
now. Cyril! His fingers no longer moved directing
her. He had sunk lower in his seat and his head had
fallen back upon one side, his face upturned to the
stars. Was he——?</p>

<p>She put the thought from her. It was impossible.
She had prayed. Not that.... He had only fainted
from pain, from sickness. Not dead—she would not—could
not believe it. She longed to reach forward—to
let him feel her hand upon his neck—that he might
know her pity and her pain. It almost seemed better
that death should come to them both now than that he
should die and not know the comforting touch of her
hand. She leaned forward and one hand left the
wheel, but she lost her touch of the air and the planes
tipped drunkenly, threatening the destruction she
courted.</p>

<p>The madness passed—and with its passing came a
calm, ice-cold. She was no longer a sentient being.
She was merely an instinct with wings, flying as the
eagle flies straight for its goal. She kept her glance
on the compass and followed the river. North-northwest.
The silver thread had become a ribbon now, reflecting
the starlight. She passed over other towns.
She could see their lights, but her gaze was fixed most
often on the distant horizon, where after a while she
would find the sea.</p>

<p>A yellowish light, painting the under side of the
plane above her head, bewildered her. She could not
understand. It was like a reflection of a candle inside
a tent. Low as it was, it blinded her eyes, accustomed
to the soft light of the stars. There was a crash
nearby, in the very air beside her it seemed, a blinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
flash of light, and the Yellow Dove toppled sideways.
Instinctively she caught it, turning as she went
and rose higher—higher—as a bird flies at the sound
of a shot below. She knew now what it meant—a
searchlight! They were firing at her with the high-angle
guns. She had come fast, but the wire from
Windenberg had been faster. She put the light behind
her and long arms of light still groped for her, but she
rose still higher, five—six thousand feet her barograph
told her. Below, to her right, a small thing, shaped
like a dragon-fly, was spitting fire—to her left another,
but she sank lower in her seat laughing at them.
Something of Cyril’s joyous bravado possessed her.
She defied them, rising far above them—higher—seven
thousand feet—eight, until she could see them no
more.</p>

<p>North-northwest! She found her course again and
flew on into the night. She had lost the river, but that
did not matter now. She knew that after a time—an
hour or more—she must come to the sea. And when
all signs of danger were gone she went down again
where she could more plainly see the earth. The moon
had come up and bathed the scene below with its soft
light, and far ahead of her she saw irregular streaks
of pale gray against long lines of purplish black. The
sea? She had lost all idea of time and distance. How
far the sea was from Windenberg she did not know,
and if she had known it, the passage of time was a
blank to her—a continuous roar, the music of the
spheres which took no thought of time or space. The
flight had lasted but a minute—and an eternity.</p>

<p>To her left the gray streaks were nearer—west
by north her compass said, and she steered for them.
Soon she made out distinctly contours of large masses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
of gray against the black—water and land. The air
was milder and she sniffed the salt. She went down
to three thousand feet to get her bearings, ever watchful
for the dragon-flies and ready to soar again at the
first flash of a searchlight. She had already learned
to avoid the planes where the lights were grouped—the
colonies of glow-worms that here meant danger.</p>

<p>Had she crossed the Belgian line? She had been to
Antwerp, to Brussels, and tried to remember what
they had looked like on the map. There was water
near Antwerp—she remembered that, inland bodies of
water which led to the sea. Now she could see beyond
the bodies of inland water to a wide expanse of gray
beyond the dark—uninterrupted gray—the ocean!
She bore to her left until her course was due west. A
searchlight flashed upon her for a second and was
gone. By the way the contours were changing she
knew that her speed was terrific. And slowly but more
and more certainly as she neared the sea, a problem
presented itself—her goal! Where was it, and how to
find it in the dark? Cyril had said that they must
land back of Ypres. But where was Ypres? Beyond
Ostend and inland—thirty—forty miles. She knew
that much from the war maps that she had pored over
with her father. But how to find it?</p>

<p>She was over the sea now. The Yellow Dove felt a
new breeze and the wheel tugged under her hand, but
the machine lifted at the touch and wheeled like a gull
to speed down the coast. Ostend! The Kursaal! If
she could get a sight of it! It was dangerous, but she
must go lower—three—two hundred feet from the sea,
where she might make out familiar profiles against the
sky.</p>

<p>The waves rose to meet her, reflecting the starlight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and just below her to the left the surf rolled in lines
of white upon the beach. Dunes, dunes interminably,
with here and there a collection of huts. A dark shape
moved in the water ahead of her, another—— Warships?
Destroyers. She wheeled out to sea and flew
above them, but before they had time even to get their
searchlights ranged upon her, the danger was past.
She would win now. The Yellow Dove was invincible.</p>

<p>A dark irregular mass ahead of her rose above the
monotony of dunes, buildings, and a bulk she seemed
to recognize—a round dome iridescent like a soap
bubble in the moonlight. The Kursaal! Ostend! She
was nearing her destination—the end of the German
lines. Friends were near—Belgians, French, and English.
Twenty—thirty miles beyond Ostend and then
inland somewhere back of Ypres she would find the
English. The English lines were thirty or forty miles
long, she remembered. It should not be difficult to find
them. She must be sure to go far enough—but not
too far—not to where the French army joined the
British forces. Cyril’s papers must go to the English,
to General French himself. He had said so.</p>

<p>She had no way of judging distance except by the
passage of the minutes. At the speed she was flying
she must turn inland in fifteen minutes. She had no
watch and she tried counting the seconds. She had
counted sixty—four times—when a battery hidden
among the dunes along the shore opened fire on her.
She was half a mile from shore, flying low, but the flash
of light startled her and the shell burst beyond. She
rose quickly, moving further out to sea, frightened, but
still self-possessed. It would not do to fail now with
the goal in sight.</p>

<p>The compass gave her course southwest by west.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
She counted again, guessing at the time she had lost,
and then, making a wide spiral out to sea and rising to
three thousand feet, she drove the Yellow Dove inland.
Searchlights were turned on her and shots fired, but
she went higher, trying to make out if she could the
lines of the opposing armies. Red and yellow lights
were displayed below to her left, and far to her right
were tiny clusters of lights, but there seemed to be no
order in their arrangement—no lines that she could
distinguish even at this height. Her keen eyes, now
inured to the darkness, made out a monoplane against
the starlight ahead of her—but she swerved to the
right, the greater power of the Yellow Dove enabling
her to rise and elude it. She flew for what seemed ten
or fifteen minutes, going steadily to the south and west,
when she drove for a spot where there were no lights
and then shut off the throttle and dove.</p>

<p>She knew that this was perhaps the greatest moment
of her great adventure. A landing place in the
dark in a country she did not know, where a church
steeple, a telegraph wire, the limb of a tree, would
bring her and her precious freight to disaster. With
the sudden shutting off of the power, a silence that
bewildered her, a silence broken only by the whirr of
the wind against the planes. Her ears ached from the
change of pressure in her swift descent. She eased
her wheel back gently, trying to make out objects below.
Dark patches—woods—to be avoided, the roof
of a house—another—lights here and there, small, obscure,
which she had not seen. She avoided them all,
planing down in a spiral toward what seemed to be
unobstructed space.</p>

<p>She breathed a prayer as the earth came up to meet
her. Death——? Whatever came—Cyril, too....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
She stared straight before her, feeling out the wind
pressure on the planes, gliding as near the horizontal
as she dared. An open field! Thank God! A gentle
shock and the springs responded. The Yellow Dove
rebounded slightly and ran along the ground smoothly
upon its wheels—then stopped. She tried to get up,
but could not. Her hands seemed fastened to the
wheel. She heard the sound of men’s voices shouting
and saw lights, but she could not seem to make a sound.
She was shivering violently, also laughing a little, but
she had no sense of being cold. She seemed very weak
somehow, and very helpless. And then, just as the
lights grew brighter—they went out.</p>

<p class="cap">“A woman!” she heard a man’s voice say at her
ear. She was lying upon the ground, and
strange faces were bending over her. “Well,
I’m damned!”</p>

<p>English!</p>

<p>“And the other?” she heard again. “Dead as a
’errin’!”</p>

<p>Doris sat up, staring at them wildly.</p>

<p>“Wait! There’s a flutter ’ere yet.” She heard the
other man say. “Come, Bill. Let’s have ’im over to
the ’ouse.”</p>

<p>Doris managed to find a whisper. “A surgeon—for
<em>him</em>,” she said to the man supporting her. “He will
not die. He is only wounded.”</p>

<p>It was her obsession. It would not leave her.</p>

<p>She saw them carrying Cyril toward the house, and
when they wanted to take her, too, she said that she
would walk. Though deathly weak, she managed to
reach the house where they had carried Cyril. They
gave her a drink of something and she revived.</p>

<p>It was a Red Cross station, they told her, and the
doctor would be here in a moment. But in the meanwhile
first aid was administered, and at her place at his
bedside she saw Cyril struggling faintly back to life.</p>

<p>“He will not die,” she repeated quietly when the surgeon
had examined him gravely.</p>

<p>“I hope not—but he’s bled a good deal. We’ll see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>They cut away his coat and wanted to send her
away, but she pleaded to remain and in a moment she
heard Cyril’s voice whispering hoarsely—“Papers—coat
pocket—Sir John French.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the surgeon cheerfully. “We’ll see
to that.”</p>

<p>“Doris.”</p>

<p>“Here, Cyril.”</p>

<p>“Rippin’ fine—of you—no mistake—old girl——”</p>

<p>His whisper trailed off into silence and at the surgeon’s
orders they led her away from his cot, but she
would not leave the room until she got the papers out
of the pocket of his jacket. An orderly led her to a
young officer with his arm in a sling who sat at a table
in another part of the building. He listened to her
story attentively and read the documents carefully, his
lips as he read emitting a thin whistle. He glanced
at his watch and for a moment left the room.</p>

<p>“It is arranged. You shall go,” he said when he
came back. “A machine will be here in a moment.”
He paused, examining her doubtfully. She was spattered
with grease and oil, but the pallor of her face beneath
its grime showed that her strength was near its
end. “Wouldn’t you trust those dispatches to me?
It’s ten miles to headquarters and rough.”</p>

<p>“No—no, I will go. I promised.”</p>

<p>But he ordered some hot coffee and bread, and thus
fortified, when the motor came around she was driven
upon her way. The young officer sat beside her, eagerly
listening, while she gave him a brief outline of their
adventures.</p>

<p>“Amazin’!” he said from time to time. “Most
amazin’!”</p>

<p>And then as she went on, he said quietly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>“You’re goin’ on your nerve, I think. Better save
your strength until we get to headquarters. It isn’t
far now.”</p>

<p>She tried to keep silent, but it seemed as though she
must go on talking. That seemed to give her strength
to complete her task, for when she sank back in her
seat and tried to relax she only grew weak thinking of
Cyril lying back there, hovering between life and death.
And then she heard herself saying aloud, “He will not
die. He has gone through too much to die now.”</p>

<p>The man beside her glanced down at her and smiled
gently.</p>

<p>“No, he isn’t going to die. Bullets don’t kill nowadays—unless
they kill at once.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” she assented. “That’s it. If he had
been going to die, he would have been dead now,
wouldn’t he?”</p>

<p>She laid her hand eagerly on the young officer’s arm
and he put his hand over hers.</p>

<p>“Palmerston is the best surgeon along this part of
the line. He’ll pull him through. Don’t you worry.”</p>

<p>“I won’t—I’ll try not to—you’re awfully kind.
Would you mind telling me your name?”</p>

<p>“Jackson. Second Leinster Dragoons. And yours?”</p>

<p>“Mather—Doris Mather. I—I don’t want to forget
your name. You’ve been very good to understand
everything so perfectly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s nothing. There are reasons—I’m on Headquarters
Staff, you know.”</p>

<p>That was one reason. But another one was that
there was a girl at home just as much worried over
his wound as Miss Mather was over Hammersley’s.</p>

<p>They passed from the rough roads between gates
into a smoother one which was bordered with poplars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
At the end in front of her she saw lights and reached a
doorway, where an orderly opened the door of the machine
and saluted her companion. Their arrival, it
seemed, was expected. Captain Jackson took her by
the arm and led her indoors, for her courage or her
nerves seemed to be failing her again, down a quiet
hall into a room where an officer with a gray mustache
sat before a lighted lamp at a table covered with papers.
She recognized him at once from the many portraits
that had appeared in the weekly papers. He
spoke to her and she tried to reply, but she could not.
She seemed only to have strength enough to thrust the
papers forward into his hand, when her knees gave way
under her and she sank in a heap upon the floor.</p>

<p>Gentle hands lifted her and laid her upon a couch in
the corner of the room. She tried to get up, but could
not. She heard the voices of the officers in the room
as from a great distance, and then a woman came and
two men carried her upstairs and put her to bed. She
realized that she was talking incoherently of Cyril, of
the Yellow Dove. They gave her something to drink
and her nerves grew mysteriously quiet. She seemed
to be sailing smoothly through the air—higher, higher—Cyril’s
fingers were pointing upward. She was tipping
the wheel toward her—ever toward her, and they
rose higher. They had reached the region of continuous
and perfect day. Cyril turned his head and
looked at her, and then he smiled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was broad daylight when she awoke, for the sunshine
was streaming in at the window. A woman sat
near her, knitting. She was an old woman of many
wrinkles, kindly wrinkles which seemed to vie with one
another to express placidity. As Doris rose in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
bed the old woman rose, too, and came forward briskly,
speaking in French.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mademoiselle is awake. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bon.</i> She is feeling
better?”</p>

<p>“Yes, better—but a little tired.” And then, as she
realized where she was, “Could you tell me——? General
French—could I see him?”</p>

<p>“All is well, mademoiselle. Monsieur le General—he
is not here now. But he will be back after a while. He
will see you, then, but first it is proper that you have
breakfast and a bath. Mademoiselle needs a bath—I
think.”</p>

<p>Doris glanced at her hand, which lay upon the white
coverlid. It was black. “Yes, I will bathe. But first
will you tell me——?”</p>

<p>The old woman smiled as she interrupted, “I was to
tell you that Monsieur yonder is better. That is what
Mademoiselle wished to know, is it not?”</p>

<p>Doris sank back upon her pillow in a silence which
gave the full measure of her joy. Cyril would recover.
She had been sure of it. She had told them last night.
God was good.</p>

<p>The news gave her strength, and the coffee and eggs
that were brought revived her rapidly. Her nerves
still trembled in memory of what they had passed
through, but when she was bathed and dressed in clean
linen garments, much too large for her, a surgeon
brought her medicine, and what was better than medicine,
news that Cyril was conscious and was asking for her.</p>

<p>But they would not let her go to him. Tomorrow
perhaps. Meanwhile the doctor would be glad to take
a message. Doris colored gently. The message that
she would have liked to send was not to be transmitted
by this means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tell him,” she said at last quietly, “that I am well—and
that I will see him when I have permission to
do so.”</p>

<p>The officer smiled, gave some directions to the old
woman and went out.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the afternoon, when dressed
in her own garments, which had been carefully cleansed
and brushed by her nurse, that she was admitted
to the office of the Field Marshal. She was shown
into his room and he greeted her with unmistakable
cordiality, offering her the chair next his own and congratulating
her warmly upon the success of her achievement
and Cyril’s.</p>

<p>“You know,” he asked quietly, “the contents of these
documents?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Their importance made it necessary that I
should.”</p>

<p>“Then of course you realize the necessity for the
utmost secrecy?”</p>

<p>“I do.”</p>

<p>The General smiled at her and brought forward a
copy of a recent issue of the London <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p>“Did you know that for the past three days England
has actually stopped criticizing me to talk about you?”</p>

<p>“About <em>me</em>?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, read,” he said smiling, and she took the paper
from him, skimming the headings of a news item he
pointed out to her:</p>

<p class="noic">MISS MATHER STILL MISSING.</p>

<p class="noic">MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE STILL UNACCOUNTED
FOR.</p>

<p class="noic">JOHN RIZZIO, THE FAMOUS COLLECTOR, A GERMAN
SPY.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>And then in the news item below:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Allison Mather, of Ashwater Park, believing that his
daughter is still alive, today offered a reward of five
thousand pounds to anyone——</p></div>

<p>She stopped reading and put the paper down.</p>

<p>“Poor Daddy!” she whispered. “O Sir John, will you
let him know——?”</p>

<p>“I have already done so, child. He knows that you
are safe.” And then with a laugh, “The five thousand
pounds—I think are mine. I need a new hospital
corps.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll give it, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“You promise?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>He took her hand and rose in the act of dismissal.
“We have supper at six. I hope you will be able to
join us.”</p>

<p>“But, General——” She paused at the door.</p>

<p>He smiled at her softly.</p>

<p>“If all goes well—you shall see him tomorrow.”</p>

<p>She colored prettily. Everyone seemed to know, but
she didn’t care. The world, in spite of its terrors, was
a garden of roses to Doris.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She did not see Cyril the next day or the one following.
His temperature had risen, and while the danger
of a relapse was not acute, they thought it safer that
she be kept away. She had worried, fearing the worst,
but the frankness of the head surgeon reassured her.
The bullet had drilled through him, just scraping the
lung. He would recover. But why take a chance of
complication when all was going well? There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
reply to that, so Doris waited at headquarters, thankful
and trying to be patient, sending two penciled
scrawls which were delivered to the wounded man.</p>

<p>It was not until three days later that she received
word that she would be permitted to see him. His cot
had been carried into a small room at the front of the
building, and she entered it timidly, the nurse, with a
smile and a glance at her watch, both of which were eloquent,
withdrawing. He was propped up on pillows,
and though pale from the loss of blood, greeted her
with his old careless smile. She sank into the chair
by the side of the bed and caught his hand to her
lips.</p>

<p>“O Cyril,” she murmured. “Cyril, I’m so glad. But
I knew you wouldn’t die—you couldn’t after getting
safely through everything else.”</p>

<p>“Die! Well, hardly. I’m right as rain. Jolly close
shootin’ that of Rizzio’s, though. Pity he had to go—that
way.”</p>

<p>She hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>“Don’t! Let’s forget him.” And then, “Have you
suffered much?”</p>

<p>“No. The bally thing burns a bit now and then—but
the worst of it is, they won’t let a chap smoke.”</p>

<p>She laughed and he caught her hand closer.</p>

<p>“How did you do it, Doris? How did you?” he
questioned.</p>

<p>“I had to, Cyril,” she said. “It wasn’t anything—except
knowing where to come down. That bothered
me. I guessed at Ypres. The rest was luck.”</p>

<p>“More than luck, old girl. Just courage and intelligence.
I felt myself failin’, up there, but I saw you
knew your way about and then I—I seemed to go to
sleep. Silly of me, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>“Silly! You fainted, Cyril.”</p>

<p>“Rotten time to faint.”</p>

<p>“You might have died up there. Once I thought you
had died. Oh, that dreadful moment! I wanted to go,
too—with you. I was a little mad, I think. I wanted
to take you in my arms and go with you—down—down.
My hands even left the wheel. The Yellow Dove toppled—but
I caught her.”</p>

<p>“Poor child!”</p>

<p>“After that I seemed to grow all cold with reason
and skill. I forgot you. I looked beyond, over
your poor head. I had to succeed, Cyril—that was
all.”</p>

<p>His hand pressed hers tenderly.</p>

<p>“You’re the only girl in the world who could do it.
I’m glad—proud——” He broke off. “My word,
Doris! There’s no use tryin’ to tell you what I think
of you. I’m no good at that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“I understand. You’re just—yourself. That’s
enough for me.”</p>

stay with poor old Udo, but I had to go. It was the
only way. I never thought we’d make it.”</p>

<p>“But we did.”</p>

<p>“<em>You</em> did. It was the Dove, Doris—the good old
Dove. Isn’t she a ripper?”</p>

<p>“I never had a fear—once she rose. How did you
happen——”</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>“It was to be a surprise. I’d been workin’ on her
for a year—tryin’ her out on the moors. Nobody
knew—until the war came—and then I told Udo, who
told von Stromberg. I tried a flight to Windenberg and
made it comfortably. Awf’ly easy thing. I stayed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
Windenberg in October, flyin’ over the English lines,
droppin’ bombs.”</p>

<p>“That was where you were——!”</p>

<p>“But I never hit anythin’. Wouldn’t do, you know.
Then when I came back I told the War Office. They
sent me for the papers. You know the rest.”</p>

<p>“O Cyril, I’m so glad it’s all over. You’ll go to
England now and rest.”</p>

<p>“For a while.” And then, “Will you marry me,
Doris? Soon?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said softly. “Whenever you want me.”</p>

<p>“Here? Now?”</p>

<p>“But, Cyril——”</p>

<p>“There’s a parson chap about here somewhere. I

<p>“Yes, if you wish it. But——”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Clothes.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. You’re jolly handsome in those togs—handsome
no end,” he repeated. “Marry me tomorrow,
Doris. There’s a dear.”</p>

<p>She leaned her face down upon his hand.</p>

<p>“We’re already married, Cyril. Up there I felt it.
Even death couldn’t have separated us.”</p>

<p>“Thank God! Kiss me, Doris.” She obeyed.</p>

<p>“I’ll see Jackson,” he whispered. “He’ll manage it.
Resourceful chap, Jackson. He’ll get us a chaplain
like pullin’ a rabbit out of a hat.”</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose I’d ever have known you, Cyril,
over there in England. You always did wonderful
things carelessly, Cyril.”</p>

<p>“I’ll prove it to you——”</p>

<p>But she had straightened and kissed his hand.</p>

<p>“No more now—I mustn’t stay. I hear them in the

<p>“Tomorrow?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Three weeks later they stood side by side at the rail
of the Channel boat on the way to Ashwater Park for
the parental blessing. The shores of France were already
purple in the distance. They had looked upon
Death with eyes that did not fear, but the sight of it
together had made the bond of their fealty and tenderness
the stronger. There was a sadness in his look and
she knew instinctively of what he was thinking.</p>

<p>“Germany, Cyril,” she said aloud. “I love it because
a part of it is you. But I love England more, because
it <em>is</em> you.”</p>

<p>Hammersley watched the receding shores beyond the

<p>“They’re followin’ false gods, Doris. Gods of steel

<p>“They <em>must</em> fall, Cyril.”</p>

<p>“They will.” And then, “But you can’t help admirin’

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>“I think about him, Cyril. Do you think he got
away?”</p>

<p>“Well, rather! I cut his bonds with a huntin’ knife
before we went down.”</p>

<p>She looked up into his face in amazement. “You
dared do that?” He laughed.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t have let him be more generous than
me.”</p>

<p>“And he let us go?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t think we <em>could</em> go. He left things to Destiny.”</p>

<p>“Good old Udo!” she repeated. And then dreamily,
“Destiny! You were not meant to die, Cyril.”</p>

<p>“Not yet.” He said slowly: “But I must go back—over
there, Doris.”</p>

<p>She shivered a little and drew closer to him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” she said. “But you’ve earned——”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t ever earn what I’ve got,” he broke in
quickly.</p>

<p>“Nor I——”</p>

<p>“I’m not much of a chap at pretty speeches and all
that sort of thing, but you’re a rare one, you know,
the rummiest sort of a rare one—the kind a chap
dreams about but never gets—and yet I’ve got you—
Oh, hang it all, Doris,” he broke off helplessly. “You
know——”</p>

<p>She smiled at him and slipped her arm through his.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” she said.</p>

<p>“Good old Doris,” he muttered. “Silly ass, aren’t

the world than “The Evidence in the Case,” a calm, dispassionate,
but forceful discussion of the moral responsibility for the present
war as disclosed by the diplomatic papers. Arnold Bennett says that
it “is certainly by far <em>the most convincing indictment of Germany</em> in

prettiest, sweetest and quaintest of old fashioned
love stories, * * * a rare book, exquisite
in spirit and conception, full of
delicate fancy, of tenderness, of delightful
humor and spontaneity.</p>


<p class="p2 noi">A SPINNER IN THE SUN.</p>

<p>Miss Myrtle Reed may always be depended upon to write a story
in which poetry, charm, tenderness and humor are combined into a
clever and entertaining book. Her characters are delightful and she
always displays a quaint humor of expression and a quiet feeling of
pathos which give a touch of active realism to all her writings. In
“A Spinner in the Sun” she tells an old-fashioned love story, of a
veiled lady who lives in solitude and whose features her neighbors
have never seen. There is a mystery at the heart of the book that
throws over it the glamour of romance.</p>


<p class="p2 noi">THE MASTER’S VIOLIN.</p>

<p>A love story in a musical atmosphere. A picturesque, old German
virtuoso is the reverent possessor of a genuine “Cremona.” He
consents to take for his pupil a handsome youth who proves to have
an aptitude for technique, but not the soul of an artist. The youth
has led the happy, careless life of a modern, well-to-do young American
and he cannot, with his meagre past, express the love, the passion
and the tragedies of life and all its happy phases as can the master
who has lived life in all its fulness. But a girl comes into his life—a
beautiful bit of human driftwood that his aunt had taken into her
heart and home, and through his passionate love for her, he learns
the lessons that life has to give—and his soul awakes.</p>

<p>Founded on a fact that all artists realize.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use

  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
